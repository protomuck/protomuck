DESCRIPTOR FLAGS|INDEX7|INDEX &

Descriptor Flags
----------------
New as of Proto 1.7 are the presense of descriptor flags. These
are just like the normal data base flags, except that they are
on the descriptor itself. As such, they go away once the connection
is gone. Also, since they are specific to the descriptor and not to
any given player, it would be possible for a player to have different
flags showing up on different descriptors. Flags can be seen by 
using dinfo. Current flags are:
DF_HTML        (Unimplemented)
DF_PUEBLO      (Unimplemented)
DF_MUF         (Unimplemented)
DF_IDLE        (Set at the same time as the IDLE flag is)
DF_TRUEIDLE    (Set as the same time as the TRUEIDLE flag is)
DF_INTERACTIVE (Set at the same time as the INTERACTIVE flag is)
DF_COLOR       (Currently does nothing. Settable via DESCR_SET prim)

As time goes by, descriptor flags will begin to play a more important
role, though for now they are for specific purposes. 
~                               Basic Commands
~
@lock
@lock <object>=<key>
--------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Locks <object> to a specific key(s). <object> can be specified as <name> or
#<number>, or as 'me' or 'here'.  Boolean expressions are allowed, using '&'
(and), '|' (or), '!' (not), and parentheses ('(' and ')') for grouping.  To
lock to a player, prefix their name with '*' (ex. '*Igor').  A key may be a
player, an object, or 'property:value'. You can only @lock objects that you
control.

The purpose of a lock varies depending on what the object is that it is being
set on:
Player   -- Prevents from robbing pennies from that player.
Thing    -- Prevents from picking up the thing.
Exit     -- Prevents from using the exit or passing through it.

When someone tries to do something but does not pass the @lock on it for
the given circumstances, they are shown the contents of the object's 
@fail field, and everyone else in the room is shown the contents of that
object's @ofail field.

See: KEYS, @OFAIL, @FAIL
~~~~~~
@name
@name <object>=<name> [<password>]
----------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST  - To use on items
             W1 Mage - @name players if @tune wiz_name = yes

Sets the name field of <object> to <name>.  <name> cannot be empty, a null
name is illegal.  
If the object is a player, the <password> must be supplied.
Wizards can rename any player by typing '@name <player>=<newname> yes'

By setting @tune wiz_name=yes, players will be unable to change their
own names, and must request name changes from a mage or higher.
~
@OWNED|@OWN
@owned <name> [= <flags/types> = [<output type>]]
-------------------------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST  - To use on self.
             W1 Mage - To use on other players.

Searches through the database for items that <name> controls.  Flags or
types can be specified to check for or against certain ones.  (A ! before
the flag indicates that it is to be excluded.) A "U" in the flags list
indicates an unlinked item.  The output types that can be specified are
owners, links (which outputs either *UNLINKED*, the object to which the item
is linked, or *METALINK* for exits linked to more than one thing), count,
and location. Players can only use @owned on themselves, so it will act
exactly like @find for them. Mages and higher can used @owned on other
players.

Valid flags:  ABCDHJKLMQSW
Flags of E, F, G, P, R, and T will match Exits, programs, Garbage,
Players, Rooms, and Things, respectively.  U will match unlinked
objects.  0-7 will match Mucker Levels.

Example:  @owned Revar=f!l3=location   will list all M3 programs (F)
owned by revar, that are NOT set Link_OK (!L), and it will give the
location of each one.

See @ENTRANCES, @FIND, @CONTENTS.

~
@password|PASSWORD
@password <old password>=<new password>
---------------------------------------
This changes your old password to the new one.

Note that passwords are case sensitive.
~
@set|&
@set <object> = [!] <flag> -or-
@set <object> = <property>: [ <string> ] -or-
@set <object> = <property>: -or-
@set <object> = <property>:[^<number>]
@set <object> =:
&<property> <object>[=<string>]
-------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use on own objects.
             W2 Wizard - To use on other's objects.
@set can modify flags, add properties to an object, or remove properties 
from an object.

By typing '@set <object> =[!]<flag>, you may set flags on objects. The
permissions from flag to flag varies in terms of what it can be set on,
and by who. Refer to the individual flag entries for details. To remove
a flag, insert the ! mark before the flag name. The flags settable in 
ProtoMUCK are:
DARK/DEBUG, STICKY/SILENT/SETUID, ABODE/AUTOSTART/ABATE, HAVEN/HARDUID/HIDE,
JUMP_OK, LINK_OK/LIGHT, BUILDER/BOUND, ZOMBIE/PUPPET, XFORCIBLE, 
VEHICLE/VIEWABLE, QUELL, GUEST, LOGWALL, MUFCOUNT, PROTECT, ANTIPROTECT, 
PARENT/PROG_DEBUG, HIDDEN, NO_COMMAND, EXAMINE_OK, MOBILE/OFFER,
MUCKER 1 through 3, and WIZARD 1 through 4

@set <object>=<property>:           -- Clears that property from the object.
@set <object>=<property>:<string>   -- Sets that property with that string.
@set <object>=<property>:^<number>  -- Sets that property with that number as int.
@set <object>=:clear                -- Clears all the props from that object.
&<property> <object>=<string>       -- Same as '@set <object>=<property>:<string>
&<property> <object>                -- Same as '@set <object>=<property>:

See: PROP TYPES
~
@propset
@propset <object> = <type>:<property>:<value>
---------------------------------------------
Permission: !GUEST    - To use on own objects.
            W2 Wizard - To use on other's objects.

Propset is used for setting properties other than the normal 'string' type
used by @set.  For example:

@propset me=int:_myint:23
-or-
@propset me=dbref:_reg/tmp:#46

Most players will not need to use this command and will be able to use the
simpler @set form.

Valid types: string, int, float, dbref, lock, and erase.

See @SET.
~
@teleport|@TEL
@teleport <thing> [=<destination>]
----------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use on own objects.
             W2 Wizard - To use without restrictions.

Moves <thing> to <destination>, if <destination> is not given, moves you to
<thing>.  Wizards may teleport anything to anywhere, provided it does not
violate the rules of the data base.
Normal players are able to @teleport objects they own back to themselves,
@tel their rooms to other rooms to set the room's parent, and @tel themselves
to other rooms as long as they are set JUMP_OK and the room they are going to
is also JUMP_OK or one they own. They can also @tel themselves into things
that they personally own.
~
@sweep|scan
@sweep or scan
--------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use.
             W2 Wizard - To get more info.

This shows what listeners are in the room, and any listening rooms down
the environment tree.
For wizards it also lists what room common communications actions such as say/pose/whisper/page are on.
~
@unlock
@unlock <object>
----------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Removes the lock on the <object>. The player must have control over the
object in order to remove the lock.

See @LOCK.
~
drop|throw|put
drop <thing>  [= <container>] 
throw <thing> [= <container>]
put <thing>   [= <container>]
-----------

Drops the <thing> if you are holding it.  It moves the object to the room
you are in, unless its STICKY flag is set, or the room has a drop-to. 
Programs are much like objects but are not affected by room droptos or
STICKY flags. A 'drop' message can be set, which will be shown to the player
dropping the object, and an 'odrop', which will be shown to the other
players in the room.  Throw and put are aliased to drop.

In order for a thing to be a container, it has to have a @conlock. See
'help container' for more details on containers.

See @DROP, @ODROP, CONTAINER, and GET.
~
examine|EX
examine <object>[=propdir]
--------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use on own objects.
             W1 Mage   - To view main examine info on other's objects.
             W2 Wizard - To view properties on other's objects.

If you control <object>, examine will give you a complete breakdown of all
fields, flags, and locks that are associated with the object.  If the optional
propdir field is supplied, then it instead lists out all the properties
directly under that propdir.  To list the base propdir of an object, use 'ex
<object>=/'.

Program-executing fields are displayed as their true text, rather than
executing the program in question.  If you do not control <object>, however,
it prints the owner of the object in question, and, again, displays the true
text of the description.

If you examine an exit you do not own, and it is linked to a MUF program that
is set VIEWABLE, then you will be given that program's dbref#.

See: PROPDIRS
~
get|take
get <object>
take <object>
get <container> = <object>
take <container> = <object>
---------------------------
Attempts to pick up <object>.  The lock on <object> is checked for a
success, and the normal path of success/fail is then taken.  On success the
object is placed in your inventory.

get <container>=<object>

Attempts to get <object> from the given container.  The _/clk lock property
on <container> is tested, and if it is true, then it checks to see if the
standard _/lok lock property on <object> tests true.  If both locks pass,
then <object> is moved into the player's inventory.  If there is no _/clk
property on <container> it defaults to failing.  The _/lok property, on
<object>, on the other hand, defaults to passing. @succ/@fail messages are
not displayed, when fetching something from a container.

Mages and above can use 'get' to pick up items remotely, as long as they
pass any locks on the object.

See: CONTAINER, @SUCC, PUT
~
give
give <player|object>=<amount>
-----------------------------
Permission: !GUEST  - To use.
            W1 Mage - To use without limits on supply.

Gives <amount> pennies from your supply to <player>.  Mortals may only give
positive amounts.  Mages do not affect their penny supplies by giving to
others, and may also give pennies to objects, changing that object's value.

~
go|move|goto
go[to] <direction>
move <direction>
go[to] home
-----------

Goes in the specified direction. 'go home' is a special command that returns
you to your starting location.  The word 'go' may be omitted. 'move' is the
same as 'go'.

~
gripe
gripe <message>
---------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Sends <message> to a file on the server. They are logged to a file 
called 'gripes' in the log directory on the server. Also, all 
ArchWizards on at the time the gripe is made will be notifed of it.
~
help|#HELP|!GUEST
help [<subject>]
----------------

With no arguments, this command returns a brief introduction. When <subject> 
is specified, it returns information specific to that topic. There are
a few conventions used throughout the help document that you should be
familiar with while reading it. 
In the parts showing syntax, the < > marks are almost always markers for
where something should go, and almost never should be included with the
actual text. 
Parts of the syntax that are enclosed in [ ] marks are optional, in that
the action will work without them, but will do something different when
the optional parts are included as well.

It is important to realize that this help file is written with only
the in-server commands and options being considered. Most MUCKs will
have MUF run front ends that will override some of the commands mentioned
in this document, such as 'page', 'say', 'look', etc, and they will very 
likely work differently that described in here. For most finished MUF run
programs, you can get additional help by typing the command, followed by
the word '#help'.

The permissions needed to do certain commands are listed under the entries.
Some are listed as !GUEST, which simply meas that command is unavailable to
characters with with the GUEST flag.
~
info
info [<subject>]
----------------

With no arguments, this command returns a brief topic list. When <subject> 
is specified, it returns detailed information on that topic. These files
are contained in the data/info/ directory on the server level.
~

Used for navigating the MPI help manual. Type 'mpi' by itself for
instructions on how to use the manual.

~
news
news [<topic>]
--------------
Displays the current news file for the game. Must be typed in full. If a
topic is given, then it displays the information on that specific topic.

Instructions on working with the news command on the server side:
The main news file for the MUCK is data/news.txt. This is a file of 
entries that are seperated by lines beginning with a ~ mark. The top
of the file is what is displayed when someone types 'news' by itself.
This should generally be your index. 
The end of the first entry is marked by the line that starts with ~.
The next entry begins immediately after and is searchable by a set
of key words on the first line seperated by | marks. For example,
if the first line after a ~ mark is THEME|HISTORY|STORY, then if 
someone types 'news theme', or 'news history', or 'news story', 
they will be shown the contents of that entry. Again, the entry ends
at the first line starting with a ~ mark. 
In addition, you can place files in the data/news/ directory. Those
will be looked up according to their title. For example, if there 
is a file in the data/news/ directory titled application, then
typing 'news application' will display that file. File titles in
the data/news/ directory will be checked before the contents of
news.txt will be. 
Note that 'help', 'mpi', and 'man' all work the same way, and each
has its related subdirectory that can be used as well.
~
page
page <player> [=<message>]
--------------------------

This tells a player that you are looking for them.  They will get a message
in the form of 'You sense <pager> is looking for you in <location>.' A
<message> is optional, and is delivered in the form of '<pager> pages:
<message>.' Your location is not revealed in message pages.

If a player is set HAVEN, you cannot page them, and they will not be
notified that you tried. You will instead be told, 'That player does not
wish to be disturbed.'

Players set GUEST can only page those that are wizard or higher.

Note: Most systems use a 'program' with a global 'page' action, which takes
      the place of the built-in 'page' command, and has more features.
~
quit|DISCONNECT|LOG OFF|LOGOFF
QUIT
----
Must be in all capitals, and typed in full. Logs out of your character and
leaves the game. Your character remains at the location you are in when you
log out, although it might be moved elsewhere while you are 'asleep.'
If you have more than one connection to the MUCK, QUIT will only disconnect
the connection in which you type the command.
QUIT can be typed at any time, even if you are in an editor or running
a program.
~
say
say <message>
"message
--------
Says <message> out loud.
You can use ' or " as a shortcut for say.
See POSE and WHISPER.
~
pose|EMOTE
pose <message>
emote <message>
:message
--------
Poses <message>. 
You can also use ':' and ';' as a shortcut for pose.

This is used for actions.  If your name was Igor, and you typed ':falls
down.', everyone would see "Igor falls down."

See POSE and WHISPER.

~
whisper
whisper <player>=<message>
--------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Whispers the message to the named person, if they are in the same room as
you. No one else can see the message.
  
Note: Most systems use a program in place of the built in whisper command. 
      These programs generally provide many more useful features.
~
who|@who
WHO [<player>]
--------------
Permissions: W1 Mage - To see Wiz-WHO.

Must be in all capitals, and typed in full. Lists the name of every player
currently logged in, their time online, how long since they last did
something, and optionally a @doing phrase of their choosing.  If given a
player name, it displays only the matching names and idle times. The 
message at the top of the @doing column may be changed by setting a prop on
#0 called _poll:<message>.

Mages may type WHO ! to get the following info on the players:
Descriptor #, Unparsed name, port #, Online time, Idle time, and ISP.
Players of W3 and higher will also get the user name of the ISP. 

New in Proto1.6 and newer is WHO !!, which gives the following info:
Descriptor #, Unparsed name, Output Kbytes, Input Kbytes, # of commands, and 
Port type.

The WHO command can easily be replaced with a @WHO action that has a wizard
flag set on it.  However, this will not work for login screens. Instead, you
can use the '@tune login_who_prog' to override the in-server WHO program
at login.

@action
@action <name>=<source> [=<regname>]
------------------------------------
Permissions: BUILDER
Creates a new action and attaches it to the thing, room, or player
specified. If a <regname> is specified, then the _reg/<regname> property on
the player is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets players refer
to the object as $<regname> (ie: $mybutton) in @locks, @sets, etc.  You may
only attach actions you control to things you control. The action can then 
be linked with the command @LINK.
Certain names cannot be used when making an action, such as 'here' or 'me'.
Use of this command can be disabled by setting: @tune building=no
~
@attach
@attach <action>=<new source>
-----------------------------
Removes the action from where it was and attaches it to the new source.
You must control the action in question being attached and the new
source that it is being attached to.

~
@CHLOCK|

@chlock <object>[=<key>]
------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST
This command lets you lock who can @chown an object, even if the object is
set CHOWN_OK. Those who can pass the lock can @chown the object, those who
don't, cannot @chown the object. Entering the command without a key will
remove the @chlock. The current @chlock on any object can be seen on the
examine screen as:
Chown_OK Key: <Key>

See: @CHOWN, KEYS
~
@chown
@chown <object> [=<player>]
---------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use.
             W2 Wizard - To use without restrictions.

Changes the ownership of <object> to <player>, or if no player is given, to
yourself.  All players are allowed to take possession of objects, rooms, and
actions, provided the CHOWN_OK flag is set. Mortals cannot take ownership of
a room unless they are standing in it, and may not take ownership of an
object unless they are holding it. Wizards can @chown almost everything, though
the PROTECT flag may limit even a Wizard's ability to @chown something.

See: PROTECT
~
@create
@create <object> [=<cost>[=<regname>]]
--------------------------------------
Permissions: BUILDER

Creates a new object and places it in your inventory. If <cost> is 
specified, you are charged that many pennies, and in return, the 
object is endowed with a value according to a special formula.

Usually the maximum value of an object is 100 pennies, which would cost 505
pennies to create. If a <regname> is specified, then the _reg/<regname>
property on the player is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets
players refer to the object as $<regname> (ie: $mybutton) in @locks, @sets,
etc.

Use of this command can be prevented by setting @tune building=no.

@idescribe|@iansidescribe|@ihtmldescribe
@idescribe <object> [=<text>]
@iansidescribe <object> [=<text>]
@ihtmldescribe <object> [=<text>]
---------------------------------

Sets the idescription field of <object> to <text>.  If <text> is not
specified, the idescription field is cleared. An idescription is what
is seen on the inside of a vehicle object, when a player inside of it
takes a look.
This command is the same as:
'@set <object>=_/ide:[text]'
'@set <object>=_/ianside:[text]'
'@set <object>=_/ihtmlde:[text]'

The ansi function sets the iansidescription on an object, and the html
one sets the ihtmldescription on an object.

--------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST
Sets the description field of <object> to <text>.  If <text> is not
specified, the description field is cleared. A description is what is
seen when a player looks at something.
These commands are the same as:
'@set <object>=_/de:[text]'
'@set <object>=_/anside:[text]'
'@set <object>=_/htmlde:[text]'

The ansi function sets the ansidescription on an object, and the html
one sets the htmldescription on an object.

@tune
@tune
@tune <data type>
@tune <option>
@tune <option>=<value>
----------------------
Permissions: W1 Mage to view
             W3 ArchWizard to change
@tune is used to configure the MUCK itself. Any w-bitted character can
type '@tune' to view a listing of most of the settings, but only W3 and
higher can actually change any of them. Certain @tuneables will not even
be viewable to any wizard less than a W3. 
ProtoMUCK can be compiled with an option to make it so that some of the
server side related @tune options can only be set by W4 or #1. In this
case, W3 wizards will see a '-' mark in front of the @tuneables that 
they cannot change.
When listing @tuneables, you can list partial matches by including
a '*' mark. For example:
@tune log* will list all of the @tuneables that start with the word 'log'.

@tune                         -- To list all of the @tuneable settings.
@tune <str|time|int|ref|bool> -- To view only the @tuneables of that type. 
@tune <option>                -- To view that option along and its info.
@tune <option>=<value>        -- To change the option to that value.

The values for integers must be numbers.
String type @tuneables must always have some kind of value.
The values for refs must be dbref#'s, or #-1 to clear them.
The values for bools must be just yes or no.
The values for times must be entered as '#d h:mm:ss'
~
@dig
@dig <room> [=<parent> [=<regname>]] 
------------------------------------
Permissios: BUILDER

Creates a new room, sets its parent, and gives it a personal registered
name.  If no parent is given, it defaults to the first ABODE room down the
environment tree from the current room.  If it fails to find one, it sets
the parent to the global environment, which is typically room #0.  If no
regname is given, then it doesn't register the object.  If one is given,
then the object's dbref is recorded in the player's _reg/<regname> property,
so that they can refer to the object later as $<regname>.  You must be able 
to link to the parent room if specified.
The use of this command may be shut off by: @tune building=no
~
@drop
@drop <object> [=<text>]
------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST
Sets the drop field of <object> to <text>. If <text> is not specified, the
drop field is cleared.  The drop message on an object is displayed when you
drop it.  On an exit, it is displayed to the player when they enter the
destination room. On a room, it is displayed when an object is dropped there.  
This command  is the same as:
'@set <object>=_/dr:[text]'
~
@fail
@fail <object> [=<message>]
---------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST
<object> can be a thing, player, exit, or room, specified as <name> or
#<number> or 'me' or 'here'. Sets the fail message for <object>. The message
is displayed when a player fails to use <object>. Without a message
argument, it clears the message.  This is the same as:
'@set <object>=_/fl:[text]'

See @OFAIL and @DESC.
~
@link|LINK
@link <object1>=<object2> [; <object3>; ...  <objectn> ]
--------------------------------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Links <object1> to <object2>.
Wizards do not have to pass any permissions checks in order to 
link any 2 objects, but non-wizard players have to pass the 
following permissions checks:
Object1 must be owned by the player, or be an unlinked exit.
Object2 must be owned by the player, or be set = L.

If Object1 is:
Player = Can only be linked to a thing if they are inside of it, 
         otherwise a room. If they do not own the room, it must 
         be set = ABODE or LINK_OK. This is how you set a player's home.
Thing  = Can be linked to a player, thing, or room. The player doing
         the command must either own object2, or object2 must be 
         set = LINK_OK. This is how you set a thing's home.
Room   = Can be linked to a room or a thing. If the player doing the
         command does not own object2, then object2 must be set = LINK_OK.
         This is how you set a room's drop-to (Where things dropped in it go).
Exit   = If the exit is unlinked, then the player becomes the owner
         upon @linking it, if they were not already the owner. Exits can
         be linked anything. If the exit is linked to:
         Player - Then using the exit will teleport one to that player.
         Thing  - Then using the exit will teleport the thing to the player.
         Room   - Then using the exit will move the user to that room.
         Program- Then using the exit will call that program.
         Exit   - Exits can be linked to multiple exits. This is called
                  METALINKING. Using the original exit will activate all
                  of the exits it is linked to.

See: @RELINK
~~
@RELINK|

@relink <object1>=<object2>
---------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

@relink works the same as @link, except that it will perform any necessary
@unlink step if the object1 is already linked to something.

See: @LINK
~~
@odrop
@odrop <object> [=<text>]
-------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Sets the odrop field of <object> to <text>.  If <text> is not specified, the
odrop field is cleared. Odrop on an object is displayed prefixed by the
player's name when s/he drops that object.  On an exit, it is displayed upon
a player's arrival to the destination room (or the location of the
destination player).  On a room, it is displayed when an object is dropped
there, prefixed by the object's name.  This command is the same as: 
'@set <object>=_/odr:[text]'

See @DROP.
~
@ofail
@ofail <object> [=<message>]
----------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

The @ofail message, prefixed by the player's name, is shown to others when
the player fails to use <object>. Without a message argument, it clears the
message. <object> can be specified as <name> or #<number>, or as 'me' or
'here'.  This command is the same as: 
'@set <object>=_/ofl:[text]'.

See @FAIL.
~
@open|
@open <exit> [=<object> [=<regname>]]
-------------------------------------
Permissions: BUILDER
Opens an exit in the current room, optionally attempting to link it
simultaneously.  If a <regname> is specified, then the _reg/<regname>
property on the player is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets
players refer to the object as $<regname> (ie: $mybutton) in @locks, @sets,
etc.  You must control the room where it is being opened and be able to
link to the room you are trying to open to. 

This command can be disabled by doing @tune building=no
~
@osuccess|@OSUCC
@osuccess <object> [=<message>]
-------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

The @osuccess message, prefixed by the player's name, is shown to others
when the player successfully uses <object>. Without a message argument, it
clears the @osuccess message. It can be abbreviated @osucc. <object> can be
specified as <name> or #<number>, or as 'me' or 'here'.  
This command is the same as:
'@set <object>=_/osc:[text]'

See @SUCCESS.
~
@pecho
@pecho <object>=<messageprefix>

Permissions: !GUEST

Sets the given puppet object's prefix message which will be prepended to all
text that gets notifed to its own via the puppet.
~
@recycle|@destroy|@rec
@recycle <object> or @destroy <object>
--------------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Destroy an object and remove all references to it within the database.  The
object is then added to a free list, and newly created objects are assigned
from the pool of recycled objects first.  You *must* own the object being
recycled, even wizards must use the @chown command to recycle someone else's
belongings.
Objects set with the PROTECT flag cannot be @recycled. 
The global_environment (Typically #0) cannot be @recycled.
@destroy is an alias for the @recycle command.
~
@stats
@stats [me]
-----------
Permissions: W1 Mage - To use on other players.

@stats provides a lot of information about the data base on the MUCK.
When used by itself, the information is about the whoel muck. Non-wizard
players can type '@stats me' to view the number of data base objects that
they personally own. 
Mages and higher can use '@stats <player>' to look up the individual info
on a single player.
The information provided by the @stats output is:
The raw number of rooms, exits, programs, players, things, and garbage.
The total count of objects in the data base, and the number of them that
are old and unused, as defined by @tune aging_time.
The number of objects that have been changed since the last save.
The date and time of the last data base save.
The amount of RAM that the garbage parts of the data base are taking up.
The amount of RAM that the compiled MUF programs are taking up.
The amount of RAM that the rest of the data base is taking up in total.
Adding up the RAM used by the garbage, the compiled MUFs, and the data base,
will give one a rough approximate on the amount of RAM that the MUCK itself
requires to run. 
The amount of data that has been read into the MUCK and sent from the MUCK
as well as the number of commands entered since starting up. W1+ only.
~
@success|@SUCC
@success <object> [=<message>]
------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST
Sets the success message for <object>.  The message is displayed when a
player successfully uses <object>.  Without a message argument, it clears
the message. It can be abbreviated @succ. <object> can be specified as
<name> or #<number>, or as 'me' or 'here'. 
This command is the same as:
'@set <object>=_/succ:[text]'

See @OSUCCESS.
~
@trace
@trace <object> [=<depth>]
--------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Starts with <object> and traces all location fields, until the global
environment room is reached or the optional <depth> is specified.  This is
generally useful for finding which rooms are parents in your heirarchy.  If
you cannot link to a particular location its name is replaced by stars ***.

~
@unlink
@unlink <dir>
@unlink here
------------
Permissions: !GUEST

 Removes the link on the exit in the specified direction, or removes the
drop-to on the room. Unlinked exits may be picked up and dropped elsewhere.
Anyone can @link an unlinked exit, which makes them the new owner of it.

See @LINK.
~
DROP-TO|DROPTO
Drop-to
-------
When the @link command is used on a room, it sets a drop-to location.  Any
object dropped in the room (if it isn't STICKY) will go to that location. If
the room is STICKY, the drop-to will be delayed until the last person in the
room has left.
~
@ENTRANCES
@entrances [<object>] [= <flags/types> = [<output type>]]
---------------------------------------------------------
Searches through the database for items that you control linked to <object>.
Flags or types can be specified to check for or against certain ones. (A "!"
before the flag indicates that it is to be excluded.) A "U" in the flags
list indicates an unlinked item.  An "@" will match only objects that have
been unused for more than 90 days.  The output types that can be specified
are owners, links (which outputs either *UNLINKED*, the object to which the
item is linked, or *METALINK* for exits linked to more than one thing),
location and count.

Valid flags:  ABCDHJKLMQSW  Flags E, F, G, P, R, and T will match Exits,
programs, Garbage, Players, Rooms, and Things, respectively.  U will match
unlinked objects.  O will match Old objects unused for longer than 90 days. 
Digits 0 to 9 will match Mucker Levels or Priority Levels. @find =P9 -> the Man

Example:  @entrances here=ED=location
Will list all Dark Exits that are linked to your current location,
giving the location of each one.

--------------------------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST    - To use on owned objects.
             W2 Wizard - To use on the whole data base.

Searches through the database for items that you control matching <name>.
Players control only objects they own; wizards control all objects, so @find
searches the entire database when they use it.

Flags or types can be specified to check for or against certain ones.
(A "!" before the flag indicates that it is to be excluded.)  A "U" in
the flags list indicates an unlinked item.  An "@" matches only objects
unused for more than 90 days.  The output types that can be specified are
owners, links (which outputs either *UNLINKED*, the object to which the
item is linked, or *METALINK* for exits linked to more than one thing),
and location. Digits 0 to 8 will match Mucker Levels or Priority Levels.

The matching on names is as follows:
	Individual words can be matched as {word1|word2|...}
	Individual characters can be matched as [abc...]
	A ? matches any character.
	A * matches any number of characters, including none.
	Any of these special charcters can be matched by putting a \ before it.

Permissions: !GUEST

This command is used to view the lines of a program. The player must
either control the program, or the program must be set = VIEWABLE in
order to @list it. 
By placing a ! right after the = sign, the '%n lines listed' message 
at the end of the output will be encased in ( ) marks, thus making it 
a comment. This is primarially for use with @archive type programs.

By placing a '#' mark after the = sign, the line numbers will
be prepended to the program's lines no matter what.

By placing a '@' mark after the = sign, the line numbers will not
be prepened to the program's lines no matter what. 

@list <program>           -- Lists an entire program.
@list <program> =n        -- Lists just the one line of a program.
@list <program> =n1 - n2  -- Lists the lines of a program between n1 and n2.

all processes for a mage or higher.  Non-Wizards only see the muf processes that
they can @kill.

The information provided by the @ps printout is:
PID: The process ID number that is unique to that process. This is a number
     assigned to each new process as it is run. It is assigned in numerical
     order as processes are started, so lower PIDs were run earlier than the
     higher ones.
Next: The next time the process is scheduled to run.
Run: The total cumulative time that process has been running.
KInst: The number of thousands of instructions the process has run during
       its run time.
%CPU: The percentage of the server's CPU time used to run the process.
Prog#: The dbref# for that program.
Player: The player that 'owns' that process. In almost every case, this is
        the player who originally called the process. In some cases, it is
        the owner of the program instead. (Such as AUTOSTART cases)
Doing: This indicates what the program is doing currently. Typically
       SLEEPING if the program is at a sleep prim, READ if the program has
       paused at a read event, or a string representing the initial arguement
       to be put on the stack when the program is finally called, when the
       program is called from things such as the QUEUE MUF prim.
See @KILL.

~
@boot
@boot <player> 
--------------
Permissions: W1 Mage or BOOT @power

Disconnects a player from the game.  If a player is connected more than once
it affects only the most recent connection. This command can not ever be used to 
boot character #1 from the MUCK, and only W4+ characters can boot wizards of
level W3 or below. 
~~~~
@DBGINFO
@dbginfo
--------
Permisions: W1 Mage
If the MUCK is running in disk-based mode (Where the props are read off the 
hard disk only when needed), this command will print out information about
the loading and unloading of the props from memory.
~~~~
@DELTA|@DLT
@delta or @dlt
--------------
Permissions: W1 Mage

Performs a delta save of the data base. This is where only the objects that
have been changed since the last save are saved. After so many delta saves,
a normal full save is generally done. The option to use delta saves is turned
on or off at compile time, so this command is not always available.
~~~~
@dump
@dump [filename]
----------------
Permissions: W2 Wizard

Only wizards may use this command. Saves the database from memory to disk.
Automatically occurs according to an interval set in the @tune table, and 
when @shutdown is used. The server will freeze while the save is done. 
If a filename is given, it will save the db to that file, and save any
subsequent dumps to it as well.
~~~
@EXAMINE

@examine <dbref>
----------------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

Given a dbref#, this command will print out information about how that
object is represented in the data base. 
~~~
@force
@force <player>=<command>
-------------------------
Causes the game to process <command> as if typed by <player>.  The Man cannot
be forced by anyone.  Wizards can force mortals.  Only the Man can force
wizards. 
@force can be used by non-wiz players to force things that they control if 
certain conditions are met:
The thing must be set = XFORCIBLE.
The player must be able to pass whatever the @flock on the thing is.
The room that the thing is in cannot be set = ZOMBIE.
The player cannot be set = ZOMBIE.
The thing cannot be set = DARK.
The thing cannot be named the same as a player on the MUCK.

This command cannot be @forced. 
~~~
@MPITOPS
@mpitops [<number>]
-----------------
Permissions: W1 Mage

Prints out memory and CPU usage information of the MPI functions with
the highest running time. If a number is given, then it shows that many
of the top processes.

~~~
@MUFTOPS
@muftops <number>
-----------------
Permissions: W1 Mage

Prints out memory and CPU usage information of the MUF programs with
the highest running time. If a number is given, then it shows that many
of the top processes.
~~~
@TOPS
@tops
-----
Permissions: W1 Mage

Prints out memory and CPU usage information of the top MUF and MPI programs
with the highest running time. If a number is given, then it shows that 
many of the top processes.
~~~
@newpassword
@newpassword <player> [=<password>] 
-----------------------------------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

Changes <player>'s password, informing <player> that you changed it. Must
be typed in full. Only W4 or #1 can @newpassword W-bitted characters. No 
one can change #1's password.
Note that is possible to @newpassword a character to have no password by
leaving the space after the = sign blank. If a character has no password,
then anything typed at the login screen will work to connect to that 
character. Useful for Guests.
~
@pcreate
@pcreate <player>=<password> 
----------------------------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

This command creates a new player. The new character will have their
initial flags determined by the flags on the ProtoType player listed
under @tune player_prototype. 
For example, of @tune player_prototype points to a player that has a
B-bit, then the newly @pcreated player will start with a B-bit.
In addition, props set on the ProtoType player will be copied over to
the new player if @tune pcreate_copy_props is set to 'yes'.
~~~~
@POWERS|@POWER
@powers [<player> [=[!]<power>]]
-----------------------------
Permissions: W4 Boy

This command is used to operate the new @powers support in ProtoMUCK.
The idea behind @powers is to give administrators the flexability to 
assign certain permissions to a player without giving that player
a full fledged w-bit. Be careful in assigning @powers, as they all
mimic abilities only available to W1 and higher, and a couple of them
allow for W3+ level abilities.  

@powers                      -- Prints out a list of the built-in @powers.
@powers <player>             -- Lists any @powers on that player.
@powers <player> =[!]<power> -- Sets or removes that @power from that player.

@MEMORY
@memory
-------
Permissions: W1 Mage

Based on how the MUCK was compiled, this command will print out some 
information about the memory the MUCK is occupying. Note that on most
systems today, the muck will not compile with this enabled, so on most
mucks this command will not do anything.

motd.txt file on the server. Mages and higher can type:
motd <message> to add a message to the MOTD, or type:
motd clear to clear all of the MOTD.

For those that do work on the server side, the MOTD is just a normal
text file and can be edited like any text file, if the in-server MOTD
command doesn't suit your needs. 
~                                Object Flags
~
COMMAND
COMMAND
-------
The COMMAND flag is an internal flag that cannot be set or unset. It
gets set on objects that have command props, and removed when the
command props are all removed. This means that objects with command
props will automatically be picked up by the command prop support, 
unless they have the NO_COMMAND prop set. 

See: NO_COMMAND, COMMAND PROPS
~~
NO_COMMAND|N
NO_COMMAND (N)
--------------
Setting this flag on something will prevent it from processing its
command prop directories, except for the @command propdir.

Setting this flag on Program objects will keep them from being
optimized during compile time, if optimize_muf is @tune to yes.

See: COMMAND, COMMAND PROPS
~~
GUEST|G
GUEST (G)
---------
If a player is set GUEST then this player has become a guest character and
must abide by all of the rules of a guest.  The guest character loses
access to many options and programs, can not enter rooms with a guest flag,
and can not change anything on themselves.  This makes things easier on the
administration so that they do not need to manualy block out all of the
commands that they don't want a guest to have.

Depending on options chosen at compile time, Guests might only be able to
go into rooms set = GUEST, or they might be blocked from rooms set = GUEST.

If an EXIT or PROGRAM is set GUEST, then no player that is set GUEST can 
use them.
Only Mage or higher can set the GUEST flag.

See: GUEST BANS
~~~~
GUEST BANS
Characters set as GUEST (G) are unable to use the following in-server
commands. Note that it is important to recognize that this does not 
affect MUF commands that have been put in over the in-server commands,
but only affects the versions of these commands built into the MUCK.

@describe          @ihtmldescibe        @propset
@ansidescribe      @iansidescribe       @purge
@htmldescribe      @idescribe           @set

@flock             @pecho               whisper
@relink
~~~~
LOGWALL|!
LOGWALL (!)
-----------

The LOGWALL flag allows wizard characters to watch the connection and
status logs; however, it will not reveal player passwords to them so do
not worry about any kind of security issues.  This flag is merely for
the paranoid or cautious. Only ArchWizards or higher can set the
LOGWALL flag, but it will work for any character that has it set.
~
ABODE|AUTOSTART|ABATE|A
ABODE or AUTOSTART or ABATE (A)
-------------------------------
If a room is set ABODE, players can set their homes there, and can set the
homes of objects there. They can also @tel their rooms into that room to 
make it their parent room.

When set on a program, it means AUTOSTART.  This means that when the game is
first started up, the program will automatically be run with a trigger of
#-1 and a 'me @' of the owner of the program.  This is useful to restart
processes that run in the background periodically. Only W1 or higher can
set a program = AUTOSTART

Exits set ABATE have a lower priority than 0. This means all other exits
that have the same name in the environment will take priority.
~
BUILDER|BUILDERS|BOUND|B
BUILDER or BOUND (B)
--------------------
Some mud restrict building commands to players whose builder flag is set.
The builder flag, BUILDER, is only meaningful for players. On such
systems, only builders can @create, @dig, @link, @open, or pick up
unlinked exits. Only a mage or higher can set this flag.
A b-bit is required to do the following functions:
@action, @create, @dig, @open

When BUILDER is set on a program, it is called "BOUND" and it causes any
functions within the program to run in preempt mode, regardless of the
multitasking mode that the process had before calling this program.  When
the execution exits this program, the multitasking mode returns to what
it was before the function was called.  This lets libraries of atomic
functions be written.
~
CHOWN_OK|COLOR_ANSI|COLOR_ON|COLOR_OK|COLOR|COLORS|C
CHOWN_OK or COLOR_ANSI or COLOR_ON or COLOR_OK (C)
--------------------------------------------------
When set on a room, program, exit, or thing, it means that anyone
can @chown that object, as long as they are not blocked from doing
so by a @chlock. 

When set on a player, it enables ANSI color where it is implemented.
Puppets of players set = COLOR_OK will also 
When set on a player, it enables ansi color on mucks that support it.

See @CHOWN and MAN 
~
DARK|DEBUG|D
DARK or DEBUG (D)
-----------------
If a room is DARK, then when people besides the owner 'look' there, the
only see the things they own. Players may set rooms they control DARK.

If a player or thing is DARK, then they do not show in many of the commands
such as 'look', 'WHO' (Depending on settings), and so on. Players may or
may not be able to set Things dark, depending on @tune settings. Only
W3 or above can set players DARK. Players set DARK will not display the
'%n has arrived', '%n has left', '%n has connected', or '%n has disconnected'
messages, nor will they trigger the messages like @succ, @odrop, etc.

If an Exit is dark, it will usually not show up when someone other than
a wizard or the owner of the room looks in the room. Players may or may
not be able to set exits dark, based on @tune settings.

Programs set D are in a DEBUG mode. When in debug mode, anyone who has
control over that program will see debug output when running it. This
means that those who do not have control over it (players other than
the owner who are also not w-bitted) will not see debug output just
because a program is in DEBUG mode. Anyone with control over a program
can set DEBUG on it.
~
HAVEN|HARDUID|HIDE|H
HAVEN or HARDUID or HIDE (H)
----------------------------

If a player is set HAVEN, he cannot be paged.

When set on a program, HAVEN is called HARDUID, and causes that program to
run with the permissions of the owner of the trigger, rather than with the
permissions of the user of the program.

When this is set in conjunction with the STICKY (SETUID) flag on a program,
and the program is owned by a wizard, then it will run with the effective
mucker level and permissions of the calling program.  If the caller was not
a program, or the current program is NOT owned by a wizard, then it runs
with SETUID permissions. 
Combining the HARDUID flag with the QUELL flag will make a program run at
the permission bit set on the program object itself, instead of at it's 
owners perm level, though no higher than the owner's permission level.

If a container object is set HAVEN it will be called HIDE and will not show
the objects within itself.
~~~~
MUFCOUNT|+
MUFCOUNT (+)
------------
If a MUF program is set MUFCOUNT, then when it is run, it will set the
following information on the program under the ~muf/ directory:
 ~muf/count      -- Number of instructions processed on last run.
 ~muf/end        -- Time the program ended, in seconds.
 ~muf/start      -- Time the program started, in seconds.
 ~muf/trig       -- Dbref of the trigger that called the program. 
 ~muf/who        -- Dbref of the player that called the program.

If a Player is set MUFCOUNT, then they will get the following
printout after running every program they control:
MUF> 23685 newfind.muf(#2988FVM2) 0s
That gives the number of instructions processed, the name and dbref# 
of the MUF, and the seconds it took to run.
~
MOBILE|OFFER|?|
MOBILE or OFFER (?)
-------------------
There is currently no function for this flag. It has been left in the
code as a BOGUS flag that can be used on MUCKs to do whatever they would
like. It can be checked for in MUF via the flag? prim.
~
EXAMINE_OK|Y
EXAMINE_OK (Y)
--------------
If any object-type is set EXAMINE_OK then it can be examined by any other
player.  This is a useful flag for helpstaff that do not have any sort of
a wizard flag set on themselves.
~
JUMP_OK|J
JUMP_OK (J)
-----------
The Jump_OK flag is used in several ways.  Unprivileged programs cannot
use MOVETO on an object unless the player either controls the object, the
room it's being moved from, and the room it's being moved to, or else they
are set Jump_OK.  A player cannot use an action that is linked to another
player unless the other player is set Jump_OK.  On some systems, where
SECURE_TELEPORTing is set up, you cannot use an action to leave a room,
unless the action is either attached to that room, or the room is JUMP_OK.
See 'man moveto' for details on the J flag's impact on teleport programs.
~
PARENT|PROG_DEBUG|%
PARENT|PROG_DEBUG (%)
---------------------

The PARENT flag will allow a room to be used as a parent room by any
player; however, it does not act like the ABODE flag in that it does 
NOT allow players or things to set that room as their home.
 
To set the parent room for another room object you type:
@teleport <room>=<parent room>
The parent room must be set either ABODE or PARENT for this to work.

If a program is set PARENT then the flag becomes PROG_DEBUG, and if
it is ran in conjunction with the DEBUG flag set on it then it will
send the debugspam to the owner if the user does not see it; however,
the backtrace will be revealed to the owner no matter what happens if
the PROG_DEBUG flag is set.
However, if set on a player then it is also called PROG_DEBUG,
except this will allow normal players that do not own the program to
see the debug spam.  
~
LINK_OK|L
LINK_OK (L)
-----------

If a room is LINK_OK, anyone can link exits to it (but still not from it).

If a player is LINK_OK, anyone can link exits to them. When a player uses
an exit that is linked to another player, they get moved to that player's
location.

A thing that is set LINK_OK will let anyone @link exits to it. See STICKY 
regarding some notes on linking exits to things.

A program that is link_ok can be called by any other program, and can be run
from actions and propqueues not owned by the owner of the program.

See @LINK.
~~~~
LIGHT|O|OLDCOMMENT
LIGHT or OLDCOMMENT (O)
-------------------
If a thing, player, or exit is set LINK_OK it is called LIGHT.  The flag
conterattacks against DARK in this situation. I.e., players set light
will still show up in dark rooms. Some MUF programs put this flag to use
in other situations.

If a program is set to OLDCOMMENT, then the comments in it will be parsed
using the traditional comment parser. This allows backwards compatability
for any programs that are having problems compiling under the new comment
parser. 
~~~~
LISTENER
LISTENER
--------
This is a system-set flag on objects that have listen propqueues. It 
cannot be @set or unset, but instead is maintained automatically by
the server. Programs can check for it though via the 'flag?' prim.
~~
HIDDEN|#
HIDDEN (#)
----------
A new DARK flag concept.  The HIDDEN flag will remove upon reconnect, but
can only be set/unset by ArchWizards on a player object. This flag also
works in conjunction with the new connection option for W3 or above:
ch <username> <password> will connect a wizard with the HIDDEN flag 
already in place. When the wizard connects the next time, the HIDDEN
flag will be removed automatically upon connecting.
~
STICKY|SETUID|SILENT|S
STICKY or SILENT or SETUID (S)
------------------------------
SILENT
A player can set themselves "SILENT" and not see all the dbrefs and dark
objects that they own.  They won't see objects in a dark room either.
They still control the objects though.  Silent is the same flag as STICKY.
STICKY
If a thing is STICKY, it goes home when dropped.
If a room is STICKY, its drop-to is delayed until the last person leaves.

If an exit is linked to a Thing, and it is located on another Thing, then if
the exit is not STICKY, the Thing the exit is located on will go home when
the exit is triggered... for whatever that's worth. 

If a program is SETUID it runs with the permissions of the owner of
the program, not the perms of the user. As of NeonMUCK and on, programs
run at SETUID by default anyway, so this purpose is obsolete. 

See HOMES and DROP-TO.
~
vehicle|viewable|V
VEHICLE or VEIWABLE (V)
-----------------------

Objects of TYPE_THING, that have the VEHICLE flag set, can contain players. 
To enter a vehicle, you can either use a MUF program to teleport you to it
via MOVETO, you can get a wizard to @teleport you into it, or else you an
use an action that is both attached and linked to the vehicle to enter it. 
This means that you can only enter a vehicle from the same room that it is
in, and you cannot use far links to enter it.  This prevents the use of
vehicles to get around locks.  Inside the vehicle, you will see it's @idesc,
instead of it's @desc, and you will not be shown it's @succ or @fail. 
Objects dropped in a vehicle will not go away to the their homes, as a
vehicle cannot have a dropto set in it.

Exits set VEHICLE cannot be used by objects of type thing that are also set
VEHICLE.

Players with the VEHICLE flag set cannot set the V flag themselves. This can
only be set by Mages or higher.

Things with the VEHICLE flag set cannot enter rooms or use exits that have
the VEHICLE flag set.  This allows a way to prevent vehicles from entering
areas where it would be illogical for them to be.

Programs set VIEWABLE can be @LISTed by any mucker, and when players examine
the action linked to a VIEWABLE program, the dbref of the program will be
given them.
~
PROTECT|*
PROTECT (*)
-----------

The PROTECT flag is a bit complicated but it is used to keep your objects
protected, or for W4 admin to keep things of theirs from being viewed by
others.
If the PROTECT flag is set on basicly anyones object it will not be able
to be changed in any way unless a MUF program is used to do so (and the
MUF program is owned by someone of a higher or equal Wizard level, if
you are a wizard).  The only change a normal player can make is unsetting
or resetting the PROTECT flag.
If the PROTECT flag is set on a W4 admins object than no lower wizard
level can access the objects information in any form.  W3 or lower admin
can not even @list the program unless it has a VIEWABLE flag set on it.
If the PROTECT flag is set on a W4 admin himself then no object can be
@chowned away or to the level in order to make sure that nobody abuses
the powers that the admin may have.
There is a way to counter-attack against the PROTECT flag: If a wizard
is set ANTIPROTECT then he/she can make programs that will not be effected
by this flag.

See the ANTIPROTECT flag also.
~
PUEBLO|$
PUEBLO ($)
----------
This flag cannot be set or unset. It is set on players that connect
on the Pueblo port of the MUCK, and removed when they connect via 
a non Pueblo port. Pueblo is a multimedia MU* client for which 
support worked its way into NeonMUCK.
~
HTML|&
HTML (&)
--------
The HTML flag signafies that someone has somewhat HTML capability, but
not on the level of what Pueblo has support for. It is set automatically
on players that connect via the webserver port, and removed whenever 
they connect via another port. It cannot be manually set or unset.
~
ANTIPROTECT|K
ANTIPROTECT (K)
---------------
The ANTIPROTECT flag is used on W3 admin so he or she may be able to make
MUF programs that will not be effected by the new PROTECT flag.  Set your
coder admin ANTIPROTECT unless you are unsure you can trust this individual
enough.
~~~
UNLINKED|U
UNLINKED (U)
------------
This isn't a true flag, in that it can't be set or unset, nor is it set
by the system for anything. However, when running commands such as @own,
@find, etc., the U flag is used for looking up unlinked exits.
~~~
OLD|UNUSED|@
UNUSED or OLD (@)
-----------------
This isn't a true flag, in that it can't be set or unset, nor checked for
via the flag? prim, nor does the system set it, but when using commands 
such as @find, @owned, etc., @ can be used to only look up old and unused
objects. 
'Old' is defined according to @tune aging_time.
~~~
QUELL|Q
QUELL (Q)
---------
A wizard set QUELL is effectively a normal player with no wizardly powers.
Programs that test to see if a player is wizard will get a false response
from '"wizard" flag?' when the player is QUELLed.  Wiz-bitted programs will
still act wizbitted whether or not the owner is QUELLED.
However '"truewizard" flag?' would return the true value. Only players of
W1 or higher can set the QUELL flag.

Combining the QUELL flag with the HARDUID flag on a program makes it so that
the program runs at the level of the bit on the object itself, instead of
at the owner's permission level. It still can't be made to run higher than
the owner's permission, however.

Putting the QUELL flag on THINGS set PUPPET or VEHICLE will make it so that
they do not echo back to the player. This allows one to turn off the echoing,
while not disabling puppet or vehicle dependent functions for that THING.
~~
IDLE|I
IDLE (I)
--------
Changed in Proto 1.6 and newer.
This flag can now be set manually by the player, as well as automatically by
the system. The player can do '@set me=IDLE' to indicate themselves as going
idle, and the flag will be removed once they enter their next command. Or the
flag will get set by the system once the player reaches the amount of time idle
as determined by '@tune idletime'. It can be checked for via the flag? prim and
is removed automatically once one disconnects.

Also, if a player would like to have their IDLE flag set earlier than the time
indicated by the @tune parameter, then they can set an integer prop on themself
under '_prefs/idletime'. 

See: TRUEIDLE
~~
TRUEIDLE
This flag works like the IDLE flag, except that it cannot be @set either by the
user or by programs. It is set only by the system when the player's idle time
reaches that indicated by '@tune idletime'. This flag will always correspond to
when the _idle/ propqueues are called, since it can only be set by the system.
This can be checked for via the flag? prim, but does not show up in the unparsed
names of players.

See: IDLE
~~
ZOMBIE|PUPPET|Z
ZOMBIE or PUPPET (Z)
--------------------
Things set ZOMBIE echo what they hear back to their owner. This is how
puppets are generally made. 
Rooms set ZOMBIE ban the use of puppets, or even puppets coming into them.
Exits set ZOMBIE cannot be used by puppets either.
Players can only be set ZOMBIE by mage or higher. Players set ZOMBIE cannot
  set Z flags on other things, nor do they get echoed to by puppets they
  already own. This effectively blocks them from having normal puppets.

If you try to run a program that you control, that has its ZOMBIE flag set,
it will drop you into the MUF debugger.  This lets you step line by line, or
instruction by instruction through a muf program, setting breakpoints to
stop at, and other nice things.  There is help available within the
debugger, via the 'help' command.

See: PUPPETS
~
XFORCIBLE|XFORCEABLE|EXPANDED_DEBUG|X
XFORCIBLE (X)
-------------
In order for an object to be able to be forced by some programs, it will
need to have this flag set and the force lock key (see @flock) set to
something passable. 

If the XFORCIBLE flag is set on a program object, it becomes the 
EXPANDED_DEBUG flag, which means that if the program is put into debug
mode, it's debug output will show a lot more data than it does in its
default setting.
~~~
INTERNAL|
INTERNAL
--------
This is a flag used by the server for a number of things. 
When programs are being edited by the in-MUCK MUF editor, they are
set INTERNAL.

~~~
MEEPER|M
MEEPER (M)
----------
Depending on compile time options, this flag may be needed in order to grant
a player access to MPI. If the MUCK was compiled with this requirement on,
then exits that are to parse MPI must be set = M as well. Only Wizard or
higher can set a Player MEEPER, but any player set with any level of M-bit,
including MEEPER, can set the M flag on exits they own.
~~~
MUCKER1|M1
MUCKER1 (M1)
------------
This is generally considered to be the learner's bit for picking up MUF
coding, sometimes referred to as Apprentice. Only a W2 or higher can set
M1 bits on players.

See: 'MAN M1' for details on this bit.
~~~
MUCKER2|M2
MUCKER2 (M2)
------------
This is the general user level programmer's bit, sometimes referred to as
Journeyman. Only Wizard or higher can set M2 on players.

See: 'MAN M2' for details on this programming bit.
~~~~
MUCKER3|M3
MUCKER3 (M3)
------------
This is the highest non-wiz programming bit, sometimes referred to as
Master. Only Wizard or higher can set M2 on players.

See: 'MAN M3' for details on this programming bit.
~~~
WIZARD1|W1|MAGE|MAGES
WIZARD (W1)
-----------
The MAGE bit is someplace in between a M3 and a W2. They are not quite
a full fleged w-bitted character, in that they do not have 'control'
over everything on the MUCK like true wizards do, however they have
access to many in-server commands, as well as more flexability with
other commands, that normal players do not. In addition, they can set
certain permissions related flags that cannot be set by other players
as well. In terms of not being able to be @purged, @frobbed, etc.,
the W1 counts as a w-bitted character. Only W4 or #1 can set W1 bits.

See: MAGE PERMISSIONS
~~~
MAGE PERMISSIONS|MAGE PRIVS
Mage Permissions
----------------
A W1 bitted character has access to a lot more MUF power. 
  See 'man w1' for details on the programming side of this W-bit.
A mage can do the following:
Examine any object, but not its properties.
Can get the wizard version of WHO by typing WHO !.
Can @boot non-wizard players.
Can use the ! to override actions to get to the in-server commands.
Can add to the MOTD and clear it.
Can force @delta saves if the MUCK was compiled to use them.
Can get the full printout of @dbginfo.
Can use @memory if the MUCK was compiled with support for it.
Can use @tops, @muftops, and @mpitops.
Can use @wall and dwall.
Can view most of the @tune table.
Can view the @usage print out.
Not blocked by the 'Wiz-Only' mode, nor affected by Max_mortals for logging in.
Unlimited pennies.
Can @name players even if wiz_name is on, without needing a password.
Can't be @forced, @purged, @frobbed.
Can look up anyone's @stats and @owned lists.
Can set the BUILDER, GUEST, VEHICLE, and ZOMBIE flags on other players.
Can run '@kill all' to kill all running processes, and can view all proccess with @ps.
~~~~
WIZARD2|W2|WIZARD|WIZARDS|
WIZARD (W2)
-----------
Wizards are the first 'real' wizard level. They control everything on the
muck, can examine the properties of anything, though they cannot view or
alter @ props. Wizards can set props on players, and are able to set and
remove ~ props. Wizards are also the lowest level that can set the LIGHT flag.
Wizards can obviously do everything that a Mage can do, so make sure to read
up on the entry 'mage' and 'mage permissions' as well for more info
on what tools are available to the Wizard level player. In addition, Wizards
have some extra commands available to them. Only a W4 or #1 can set the W2
bit. See 'man w2' for information on a wizard's access to MUF prims.

See: WIZARD PERMISSIONS
~~~
WIZARD PERMISSIONS|WIZARD PRIVS
Wizard Permissions
------------------
Wizards are much like the normal W bitted character on FB style systems,
except that they do not have access to most of the server related commands.
Wizards are treated by the MUCK as if they are an owner of everything, in
terms of how permissions are checked. 
They do have a few more commands available to them that mages do not, however
as indicated below:
Can force a full @dump of the data base.
Can toggle @restrict.
Can pull up the dinfo on a player.
Can read gripes by typing 'gripe'.
Unrestricted use of @teleport.
Get more information from @sweep.
Can @chown anything to anyone, except when the PROTECT flag prevents such.
Can @link anything, and @open exits anywhere. 
When they use @find, it searches the entire data base.
Can @purge players with @purge <player>=yes
~~~~
WIZARD3|W3|ARCHWIZARD|ARCHWIZARDS
ARCHWIZARD (W3)
---------------
ArchWizard is a fully empowered wizard, comparable to the normal W level
of FB style MUCKs. There is not much that a W3 cannot do on a MUCK.
See 'man w3' for details of what coding power an ArchWizard has access
to. This is the first level to have access to be able to read and
manipulate the @ level props. 
Naturally, a W3 can also do everything that the W2 and W1 can do, so
make sure to read their lists of powers as well. 
W3's can also control the @tune table. If the MUCK was not compiled to
enforce W4 level @tuneables, a W3 will be able to change anything on the
@tune table, otherwise they will see a '-' mark in front of the 
parameters that they cannot set. Only a W4 or #1 can set W3 bits.

See: ARCHWIZARD PERMISSIONS
~~~~
ARCHWIZARD PERMISSIONS|ARCHIWIZARD PRIVS
ArchWizard Permissions

Only ArchWizards or higher can:
Run @armegeddon to shut the muck down without saving.
Run @shutdown to shut the muck down with saving.
Run @restart to restart the binary.
Do @pcreate and @frob.
dboot other players.
@uncompile all the programs out of memory.
Run @sanity to check the data base structure.
Run @sanfix to try and automatically fix any errors found.
Use @examine to view an entry in the MUCK's data base.
Use @newpassword to reset a player's password to something else.
Use @tune to change the MUCK settings.
~~~~
BOY|W4|WIZARD4
BOY (W4)
--------
A BOY level player is a player that has been given power almost 
completely compareable to character #1. This is primarially used
for co-headwizard situations, and should not be given out freely.
There is little a W4 can do that a W3 cannot do. The primary
coding differences are highlighted in 'man w4'. Only #1 can set
W4 bits on characters.

See: BOY PERMISSIONS
~~~
BOY PERMISSIONS|BOY PRIVS
Boy Permissions
---------------
In addition to being able to do everything a W3 can do, W4's
can also set W1, W2, and W3 bits on other players. They can
also set @powers capabilities on players, and run @sanchange
to try to manually alter the MUCK's data base to fix a problem.
W4 also have certain @tune settings that only they can set.
W4 is also the lowest level that can run @autoarchive.
~~~
W5|WIZARD5|THE MAN|THEMAN|#1
MAN (W5)
--------
W5 is not a settable bit. It is used to represent character #1.
The only things that character #1 can do that a W4 cannot do is
to set W4 bits, and to run @fixwizbits.
~~~
~                               Miscellaneous

COMMANDS
User Commands
-------------
All sorts of commands are available to players. Common ones are listed by
typing 'help'; you can get a listing of all commands by typing 'help index'
and learn about each one with 'help <command>' as needed. 
WHO, QUIT, OUTPUTPREFIX, and OUTPUTSUFFIX are all checked before anything
else, and therefor always work no matter what.
~
Control of Objects|control
Control of Objects
------------------
There are 5 rules to controlling objects:

1) You control anything you own.
2) A wizard or the Man controls almost everything.
3) Anybody controls an unlinked exit, even if it is locked.
   Builders should beware of 3, lest their exits be linked or stolen.
4) Players control all exits which are linked to their rooms, to
   better facilitate border control.
5) If an object is set CHOWN_OK, anyone may @chown <object> and gain
   control of the object.

However, the new PROTECT flag may change some of these rules.

See PROTECT, CHOWN_OK and @CHOWN.
~
failure
Failure
-------
You fail to use a thing when you cannot take it (because it's lock fails).
You fail to use an exit when you cannot go through it (because it's unlinked
or locked). You fail to use a room when you fail to look around (because
it's locked). You fail to use a player when you try to rob them and can't.

See STRINGS, @FAIL and @OFAIL.
~
gender|sex|species
Gender
------
How to set your sex: (this is your physical gender not sexual preference)

@set me=sex:          To clear your sex
@set me=sex:male      If you're a guy
@set me=sex:female    If you're a gal
@set me=sex:neuter    If you're undecided

You can also select a species with '@set me=species:...'.
(Bear, raccoon, beaver, fish, fox, merfolk, etc.)

If a player's sex is set, %-substitutions will use the appropriate pronoun
for that player.

See SUBSTITUTIONS.
~
here
here|ME|HERE OR ME
----
The word 'here' refers to the room you are in.

For example, to rename the room you're in (if you control it), you could
enter "@name here=<new name>".

The word 'me' always refers to yourself.

For example, '@set me=test:string' would set the prop on yourself.
~
homes
Homes
-----
Every thing or player has a home. This is where things go when
sacrificed, players when they go home, or things with the STICKY flag
set go when dropped (See STICKY). Homes are set with the @link
command. A thing's home defaults to the room where it was created, if
you control that room, or your home.

You can link an exit to send players home (with their inventory) by "@link
<dir>=home".  Drop-tos can also be set to 'home' (See DROP-TOS). @teleport
accepts home as an argument, so you can @teleport things (and players if you
are a wizard) to their home.

See @TELEPORT and @LINK.

~
linking
Linking
-------
You can link to a room if you control it, or if it is set LINK_OK or ABODE.
Being able to link means you can set the homes of objects or yourself to that
room if it is set ABODE, and can set the destination of exits to that room if 
it is LINK_OK. See LINK_OK, and @LINK.

~
newbie|new|
Newbie Advice
-------------
Some things to do when starting out:  (Don't type the ''s nor <>s.)

     1) Give yourself a description with '@desc me=<description>',
        then look at yourself with 'look me'

     2) Set your description: '@desc <object>=<description>'

     3) Set your gender with '@set me=gender:male' or '@set me=gender:female'
        (or '@set me=gender:neuter' to be an'it)

     4) Change your password from the one given when you first connected with
        '@password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>'
~
Mucker Levels|Priority Levels|Levels1
Mucker Levels (Priorities and Permissions)
------------------------------------------

The mucker level of a player or program specifies whether or not a player
can make MUF programs, and what permissions they will have when the programs
are run.  (See 'man mucker levels')  Only a wizard may set the mucker level
of a player, and a normal player may only set the mucker level of programs
they own to less than their current mucker level.  A program cannot be set
to mucker level 0, since it doesn't mean anything.

When the mucker level of an exit is set, is it called the exit's priority
level.  The priority levels let you specify that certain exits are not
overidable by local actions.  When an exit is searched for, in the
matching routines, it will match like it used to, except that if it finds
an exit, later in the search order, that has a higher priority level, it
will choose that exit instead.

You can set the priority level of an exit by setting its Mucker Level.
(ie: @set exit=2)  A level of 0 is the lowest priority, and a level of 3
is the highest priority.  Only a Wizard can set the priority level of an
action or exit.

Type 'help levels2' for more help on mucker levels.

~
levels2|priority levels2|mucker levels2

When the server looks for the standard "connect", "disconnect", or "look"
actions, it will ignore any actions with a priority Level of 0.  When an
action is @attached to another object, @named to something else, or
@unlinked, its Priority Level is reset to 0.

If COMPATIBLE_PRIORITIES is #defined on your system, then exits that are
on room or player objects will never act as if they have an effective
priority level of less than 1.

See newlevels.
~
dbref|objref
DBRef
-----
Each object has an ID number (the 'dbref'), which appears after the name of
an object, and is followed by any flags on the object; i.e. foo(#3672PB) is
a Player, named foo, with dbref #3672, who has a BUILDERS bit. This number 
is a database reference, and is used to specify objects at a distance.

ex #<room ID number>

You will only see the ID number of objects you own, or which are set
LINK_OK, ABODE, or CHOWN_OK. Wizards can see the numbers and flags on all
objects.

See also FLAGS.
~
objects
Objects
-------
You can specify objects (things, players, exits, and rooms) by name if
they're in your inventory or in the same room as you. You need only type
enough letters of the name to be unambiguous. You can also specify objects
anywhere by their ID numbers, in the form #<number>. Players in other rooms
may be specified in the form *<player name> if you are a W1 or higher. The 
keywords 'me' can be used for yourself, and 'here' for the room you're in.

See TYPES.
~
outputprefix
OUTPUTPREFIX [string]
---------------------
Must be in all capitals, and typed in full.  Prints the given line before
the output of every command, setting them apart from other messages. For
example, typing OUTPUTPREFIX [OUTPUT BEGINS], will cause the line:
[OUTPUT BEGINS] to appear on your screen just before the actual information
from that command gets displayed to you. Enter no string to clear it.

See OUTPUTSUFFIX.
~
outputsuffix
OUTPUTSUFFIX [string]
---------------------
Must be in all capitals, and typed in full. Prints the given line after the
output of every command, setting them apart from other messages. For example,
typing OUTPUTSUFFIX [OUTPUT ENDS], will cause the line:
[OUTPUT ENDS] to appear on your screen just after the actual information
from a command has been displayed to you. Enter no string to clear it.

See OUTPUTPREFIX.
~
strings|MESSAGES
Strings
-------
Objects have several standard strings (Lucky 13):

@name      1) a name.
@desc      2) a description.
@htmldesc  3) an html description (for web/pueblo users).
@ansidesc  4) an ansi description.
@idesc     5) an inside description (for vehicles).
@ihtmldesc 6) an inside html desc (for web/pueblo users).
@iansidesc 7) an inside ansi description.
@succ      8) a success message (seen by the player).
@fail      9) a fail message (seen by the player).
@drop     10) a drop message (seen by the player).
@osucc    11) an osuccess message (seen by others).
@ofail    12) an ofail message (seen by others).
@odrop    13) an odrop message (seen by others).

See properties.

~
Substitutions|pronouns|pronoun_subst|pronoun substitution|%a|%s|%o|%p|%r|%n
Pronoun Substitution
--------------------

@osuccess, @ofail, and @odrop messages may contain %-substitutions,
which evaluate to gender-specific pronouns if the player's sex is
set. They are:

    %a (absolute)       = Name's, his, hers, its.
    %s (subjective)     = Name, he, she, it.
    %o (objective)      = Name, him, her, it.
    %p (possessive)     = Name's, his, her, its.
    %r (reflexive)      = Name, himself, herself, itself.
    %n (player's name)  = Name.

Capitalized pronouns are also available with %A, %S, %O, %P, and %R.
If you need a '%', use %%.

Note: Please do not confuse the MUCK %r with the MUSH %r.  MUCKs use \r
for returns instead of %r.

Example:  @ofail teapot=burns %p hand on the hot teapot.

See GENDER.

~
success
Success
-------
You successfully use an object when you take it. You use an exit
successfully when you go through it. You successfully use a room
when you look at it.

See STRINGS, @SUCCESS and @OSUCCESS.
~
timestamps
Timestamps
----------
Every object has a timestamp, which includes the time last used, the time
last modified, the time the object was created, and the number of times that
that object has been used by a player. They are shown by using EXAMINE.
Use count and last-used vary depending on the type of object:
Exits are used when invoked or looked at, thus setting Usecount and lastused.
Rooms are used when entered or looked at, however their usecount will only
    increase when they are looked at via the in-server look program. Their
    lastused date will indicate the last time someone entered it.
Things are used when looked at, taken, or dropped, and both the usecount 
    and lastused stamps will be modified.
Programs are used when run. Both the lastused and usecount will increase.
Players are used as they enter commands, but the use count only increases
    once each time they connect. So while the lastused time will indicate
    the last time a player did anything, the usecount does not go up for
    every action they perform.

Examining an object does not count as looking at it.
~
object types|types
Types of Objects
----------------
There are 5 types of objects: things, players, exits, rooms, and programs.
The first letter following an object's ID number indicates the type:
P(layer), E(xit), R(oom), otherwise, thing.

Things are inanimate objects that can be carried.  Players are animate
objects that can move and carry. Exits are the means by which objects move.
Rooms are locations that contain objects and linked exits. Programs are
player-written extensions to the game.
~
PROPDIRS|PROPDIRS1|DIRS|DIR
Propdirs (Property Directories)
-------------------------------
Properties are stored on objects, and organized into directories of
properties.  This speeds things up, and keeps you from being spammed on
examines.  To examine the properties on an object, use 'ex <obj>=<propdir>'. 
where to examine the base properties in an object, <propdir> would be '/'. 
You can see the value of a single property with 'ex <object>=<propname>'.

Propdirs are a method of storing and organizing properties to speed access
and to provide a sort of built-in organization.  The basic idea is to make
something similar to a 'filesystem' for properties.  In this analogy, each
person would be a filesystem, with a root directory and (theoretically) an
infinite number of properties beneath that.

A property has been expanded with the idea that each property may now
contain a new property list -- the 'propdir'.  properties can both have a
value (either integer or string as before) _and_ contain other properties.

The actual directory entries may ALSO contain data.  Propdirs' only real
'visible' changes are in the names of properties -- '/' is used as the
property directory separator, and so will not appear in the names of the
properties when listed through 'examine' or MUF programs.

Type 'help propdirs2' for more help.

~
PROPDIR2|PROPDIRS2

Property protections have also been expanded -- the . and _ may appear
either at the beginning of the property name or immediately following a '/',
and that property will have the appropriate protections.  For example, the
property '/mail/.inbox/mesg/#' would have the same protections as '.mesg#'
would now.

There are two ways to remove a property list:

* First, and most straight forward, is to remove the property that contains
  it.  so, in the previous example, removing the property '/mail/.inbox'
  would (recursively) remove all properties under .inbox before removing
  .inbox itself.

* The second way is to remove all properties within the property list
  yourself.  When the last property is removed, the parent property (the one
  that contained the property list) is examined to see if contains data.  If
  it does, then the property list only is removed.  If the property doesn't
  contain data then it is removed also.

Type 'help propdirs3' for more help.

~
PROPDIR3|PROPDIRS3

Because of the first method of removing propdirs, the ability to have a
property list and value in the same property should be used sparingly.

If you try to access a property ending in '/', in MUF, it will give a
programmer error, except in NEXTPROP, in which it will give the name of the
first property in that propdir.

The last visible, non-MUF change that propdirs bring is that 'examine' will
no longer show properties _directly_.  Instead it will say:

  "[ Use 'examine <object>=/' to list root properties. ]"

Examine now can take an argument which is the property or propdir to view. 
If the property name given ends with a '/', all properties in property
directory will be listed, otherwise the single property named will be shown.

Type 'help propdirs4' for more help.

~
PROPDIR4|PROPDIRS4

'addprop' will no longer allow a ":" in the property name.  To clear a
propdir's value without deleting the proptree below it, from MUF do a
'"" 0 addprop' to it.

A property can *not* have both a string and integer stored at the same
time anymore.  The old property.c was lax and allowed this, even though
the integer value would be lost on dbload.

Type 'help propdirs5' for an example.

~
PROPDIR5|PROPDIRS5

Property and Propdir Usage Examples:
  Lines indented only 2 spaces are what the user is typing.
  Lines indented 6 spaces are what the MUCK is returning to the user.
  Lines in []'s are comments on what's going on.

  [first, lets set up a bunch of properties]
  @set me=first:a property.
  @set me=second:another property.
  @set me=first/one:A property in a propdir
  @set me=first/two:Another property in a propdir
  @set me=third/prime:three

  [Okay, now lets see what properties we have.  We use the examine command
   to do that, with a second argument, to tell it what we want to list in
   the way of properties.  In this case, since we want to list the base level
   properties, we use '/'.]

  ex me=/
      first/: (string) a property.
      second: (string) another property.
      third/: (no value)

   properties that we set.  The /'s at the end of some of the property
   names means that there are sub-properties that we can list.  When we
   set a property like 'first/one', it's actually creating a sub-property
   named 'one' beneath a property named 'first'.  If 'first' doesn't
   already exist, then it will create that property.  Let's list what
   sub-properties we created under 'first'.]

  [Here we see the properties that we set as sub-properties under 'first'.
   We examined for 'first/' to list the sub-properties.  The / at the end
   of the name tells the game that we want it to list the sub-properties
   of that property, and not that property's value itself.  Lets see what
   value the property 'first' has, itself.  To do this we leave off the '/']

NEWLEVELS|NEW LEVELS|PROTOLEVELS|PROTO LEVELS|WIZ LEVELS|PROTO WIZ LEVELS
New Level System
----------------

The new M9 system consists of an MPI level, 3 Mucker levels, 5 Wizard levels,
and of course, the Man.  The Builder flag is separate from Mucker levels.

0 -- Player     (  )  No MPI or Muf abilities.
1 -- Meeper/MPI ( M)  Can parse {mpi} commands.
2 -- Mucker1    (M1)  Old M1, muf restricted to local access, 20k inst limit.
3 -- Mucker2    (M2)  Old M2, general muf level, 80k inst limit.
4 -- Mucker3    (M3)  Old M3, 320k inst limit.
5 -- Mage       (W1)  High Level Coder or Staff member.
6 -- Wizard     (W2)  General wizard level. For most wizards.
7 -- ArchWizard (W3)  Level for head-wizards (head-coder, head-@pcreator).
8 -- The Boy    (W4)  For co-head wizards or server wizards.
9 -- The Man    (W5)  Mr. Omnipotent himself. Also known as char dbref #1.

Only W5 or W4 admin can set or remove W-bits from players, but W2 or W3 can 
also set other players from M0 to M3.  Only W5 admin (char #1) can set or 
change the W4 flag on other players.  Anyone can set things/programs/rooms/exits 
to their mucker level (except W5, which is only set on char #1).

To convert a db's mucker system from M4 to M9, the Man can use @fixwizbits.
M8 is 100% compatible with the M9 system.

The requirement for the MPI flag can be turned off (and usually is) at 
compile time.  This will eventually be changed to a @tune option.

You can look up: M M1 M2 M3 W1 W2 W3 W4 W5
~~~
@armageddon
@armageddon <muckname>
----------------------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

Shuts down the muck without saving the data base in the process. This command 
must be typed in full and the muck name is case sensitive and must match the
@tuned muckname.
Failed attempts at using @armageddon are logged to the status log with the 
prefix SHAM, and successful uses of this command are logged to the status log
with the prefix DDAY.
~
WIZCHAT
Wizchat ?        (Show who is on wizchat)
Wizchat #<spoof>
Wizchat :<pose>
Wizchat <message>
-----------------
This is an internal wizchat program, usually just for while you
are getting started on building the MUCK. Often replaced with
a MUF front end.
~
@conlock
@conlock <object>=<key>
-----------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Locks a container from or to players or objects. Those who can pass the
lock will be able to take things out and put things into the container.
Those who cannot pass the lock cannot do so. The current @conlock on
any object can be found under the examine screen as:
Container Key: <key>

See: CONTAINERS, KEYS
~
@flock|@FORCELOCK
@flock <object>=[<force lock>]
------------------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Makes sure that only certain players or objects can @force the given
object or player. If entered without the key, then it clears the lock.
The key can be seen under the examine screen as:
Force Key: <key>

See: KEYS
~
@doing
@doing [<doing string>]
-----------------------
Permissions: !GUEST

Sets a 'Doing...' message for the WHO screen for your own self.
If the <doing string> is not provided, it clears it instead. This
command is the same as doing:
'@set me=_/do:[text]'

For administrators: If you set a message on the prop '_poll' on room
#0, then the 'Doing...' string will change to what you type there.

~
@restart
@restart <muckname>
-------------------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

Restarts the muck.  Must be typed in full. The muckname part is case 
sensitive and must match the @tune muckname value exactly in order to
restart. Failures to restart are logged to the status log with the
prefix of:
SHAM
Successful restarts are logged to the status log with the prefix of:
REST

Restarting the muck involves booting all the players, shutting down all
the programs, then shutting down the binary, then starting the binary
back up. If the binary was changed since the last time the server was
started, then the muck will start back up on the new binary.
~~~
@RESTRICT
@restrict <on|off>
------------------
Permissions: W2 Wizard

This command toggles whether or not non-wizzes can log into the MUCK.
By doing @restrict on, only those with a W1 bit or higher can connect.
~~~
@SANITY
@sanity
-------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

Scans the data base, looking for errors, invalid values, and other 
inconsistencies that would indicate a damaged data base. Will report
if the data base appears to be damaged.

See: @SANFIX, @SANCHANGE
~~~
@SANCHANGE
@sanchange <dbref> <field> <object>
-----------------------------------
Permissions: W4 Boy

Allows a W4 or #1 to directly change the data base entry for a specific
object. This is done by picking a dbref, picking a field for that entry,
and then setting the new object that it is to point to. The fields are:
exits: This points to the first exit on the dbref object.
contents: This points to the first content on the dbref object.
next: This points to the next exit or content after that object.
location: This is that object's current location on the MUCK.
home: This is the object's home.
owner: Who owns that object.

WARNING: Use of this command is very dangerous if you do not know what
         you are doing. Placing the incorrect values in the fields will
         corrupt your data base and may ruin it permanently, so make sure
         to make a server-side backup of the data base before tinkering
         with this command. 

See: @SANITY, @SANFIX
~~~
@SANFIX
@sanfix
-------
Permissions: W3 ArchWizard

This program scans through the entire data base and tries to correct any
values that are found to be a problem. This is typically run after @sanity
has reported to have found an error. Results of the @sanfix are logged to 
a log called: sanfixed.
If @sanfix fails to repair the data base automatically, it will instruct
the user to repair it by hand. This would be done by using @sanchange.

See: @SANITY, @SANCHANGE
~~~
ANSI|COLOR
ANSI or COLOR
-------------
ProtoMUCK servers have support for three different ansi standards at
this time.  However, they are coded through the use of softcode.  The
three supported formats are: STANDARD, NEON (or GLOW), and MUSH.
To allow yourself to see ansi colors type: @set me=COLOR
To turn off ansi colors type: @set me=!COLOR

See also COLOR_ANSI, STANDARDANSI, NEONANSI, MUSHANSI
See: 'man CUSTOM COLORS' for information about color customization.
~
STANDARDANSI|STANDARD ANSI
Standard ANSI
-------------
Standard ANSI support is taken from the new Fuzzball distribution (FB6.xx)
for future compatability reasons.  It is just the normal, standard ansi
format that makes \[ as the escape code.
Eg. \[[1m makes the color bold.
To see more of an explanation on syntax type: man standard ansi
~
NEONANSI|GLOWANSI|NEON ANSI|GLOW ANSI
Neon ANSI / Glow ANSI
---------------------
The ANSI colors from the NeonMUCK distribution has been kept as-is.
To see more information on this ansi standard for mucks please type: 
man neon ansi

~
MUSHANSI|MUSH ANSI
MUSH ANSI
---------
This ANSI set is taken from the MUSH/MUX servers for those that are used
to that ansi standard set.  It is perhaps the easiest one to learn,
understand, and takes the least time to type.

To get more information please type: man mush ansi

~
WWW|WEBSERVER
Web Support
-----------
Some ProtoMUCK sites have web support installed along with a few default
programs.  If one or two of the default programs are installed into the
server then you may be able to setup your own mini-webpage off of the
muck itself.  On the majority of sites, the web port is one port under
the normal non-pueblo telnet port; however, some sites may have it on
another port and if they do the admiinistration should have the site
posted up somewhere on the MUCK.
If your MUCK has support for personal webpages, then you may type the
following to get your own webpage:
lsedit me=_/www
That will create a page at the following address:
http://<site address>:<web port>/~<character name>

Or you can lsedit me=_/www/page2 which will create a page at:
http://<site address>:<web port>/~<character name>/page2

See: WEBSERVER2
~~~~
WEBSERVER2
Configuring the WebSever
------------------------
The @tune www_root is a room that webserver calls are to go to when 
looking for properties global for the MUCK. The properties are set
under the _/www/ directory. See 'man webserver' for more details.

The @tune www_surfer is a player that defines the 'me @' when 
webserver called MUF programs are run. Both of these @tuneables
need to be set before webserver calls can be made.

It's possible to make a custom 404 File Not Found message for the 
MUCK to show whenever the requested location is not found. Simply
lsedit a list on the www_root room as http/404 and that will get
displayed instead.
~~~~
BOGUS|PSEUDO|PSUEDO
Bogus Commands
--------------

Bogus commands can be made using exits. For example, to make a 'sit'
command, one could "@open sit", then "@link sit=here" (because unlinked
exits can be stolen), "@lock sit=me&!me" (impossible to be both at once,
therefore always fails), and "@fail sit=You sit on the chair."; "@ofail=sits
on the chair.".  Since nobody can go through it, it always fails. The @fail
message is displayed to the player, and the @ofail message (preceded by the
player's name) to everyone else.
~~~~
KEYS|LOCKS|LOCKSTRINGS
Keys
----
MUCK Keys are fairly flexible, and when fully understood, can be used to
create almost any kind of lock one could want. 
First of all, the symbols usable in locks are:
| = OR      & = AND      ! = NOT

The simplest lock is to lock something against or to players specifically.
@lock <object>=me        -- Locks that object to you and only you.
@lock <object>=me|*Akari -- Locks that object to you and Akari only, assuming
                            Akari is the name of another player on the MUCK.

The next option would be to lock something to a specific object or objects.
@lock <object>=#2989     -- Locks it so that anyone carrying the object with
                            that dbref# can enter. More objects can be listed:
@lock <object>=#2989|#2332|#1232..... 

Locks can be made to MUF programs as well:
@lock <object>=#2333     -- This will call program #2333 when someone tries
                            the lock. If #2333 returns any true value, then
                            the player passes the lock. If the MUF program
                            returns a false value, returns nothing, or hits 
                            a sleep or read prim, the player does not pass.

See: KEYS2
~~~~
KEYS2|LOCKS2|LOCKSTRINGS2

You can lock something to a prop. This will make it so that if the prop can
be found anywhere in the of the player trying to pass the lock, then they
can pass it.
@lock <object>=_friend:yes -- Any player with _friend:yes set on them will
                              pass that lock. However, if that prop is found
                              on the exit or thing itself, or if the prop is
                              found on the room in which the player is, then
                              the player will still pass, even if the prop is
                              not on themself.

Props -can- be parsed for MPI as well. For example:
@lock <object>=key:1
@set <object>=key:{or:{day},{eve}}

Assuming {day} and {night} are MPI macros on that MUCK, if someone tries to 
use the object, and the MPI string on the 'key' prop returns 1, then they 
will be able to. If the MPI string parses out to 0, then the player would be 
unable to. 
~~~~~~
PROP TYPES|PROPERTY TYPES|PROTECTED PROPS|WIZ ONLY PROPS|WIZPROPS|WIZ PROPS|PROPERTIES|PROP
PROPERTY TYPES
--------------
There are a couple special symbols used while setting props that players and
admin need to be aware of:
Default  -- Properties that start with no special symbol can be set on anyone by
            anyone using basic MUF or even MPI and can be read by anyone using
            MPI or basic MUF.
 . Props  -- Properties that start with a . mark cannot be read by MPI or
            MUF running under M1 or M2 permissions, but can be read normally
            by a player by examining objects they control. They cannot be set
            by using non-W-bitted MPI, nor MUF running at a level lower than
            W2, on objects the player does not own.
 _ Props  -- Properties that start with a _ mark can be read by MPI or basic
            MUF code, but cannot be set by MUF or MPI on another player's
            object when running at levels under W2.
 ~ Props  -- These props can be read by any MPI or MUF code, as well as seen
            by any player when examining their own objects, but ~ props can
            only be set or removed by a W2 or higher, or MUF running under
            that permission level.
 @ Props  -- These props cannot be seen, set, removed, or changed by anyone
            other than W3 level admin, or MUF programs running under W3 
            permissions.
These are often referred to as:
. = HIDDEN, _ = PROTECTED, ~ = WizOnly, @ = WizHidden

See: PROPDIRS
~~~
GARBAGE|
Garbage
-------
When an object is recycled, it's dbref# is -not- forgotten. Instead the 
object's information is cleared from memory, and that dbref# becomes
a Garbage object. Garbage objects still take up some space, but not as 
much as normal objects. Once an object is Garbage, that dbref# becomes
available for use when objects are made in the future. 

Garbage objects cannot be removed from the data base, i.e., data bases 
never go down in their number of objects, only up. Data bases increase
in size whenever a new object is made and there are no more Garbage
objects to use.
~~~~
DESCRIPTORS|CONNECTION NUMBERS|CONNUMBERS
Descriptors and Connection Numbers
----------------------------------
When a connection is made to the MUCK, either via the login screen, the
webserver, or any other means, that connection is assigned what is called
a Descriptor number. That number does not change throughout the duration
of the connection, and is only lost once that connection is dropped. Even 
when using commands such as relog, the descriptor number remains the same 
until the player quits entirely. 

Mages and higher can type WHO ! to get the player descriptor numbers in
the first column.

Connection numbers pertain to a player's position on the WHO list. The
player most recently connected is position 1. These change frequently, 
as players connect and disconnect.
~~~
OVERRIDE|
Admin Override
--------------
Any character with a W1 or higher can use an override mark to use the
inserver version of a command in place of any MUF front end that has 
been added. For example, typing:
!say 
would allow the player to use the in-server say command instead of the
MUF say front end that is normally used. The override token can be
changed at compile time, so may vary from MUCK to MUCK.
~~~~
EXIT PRIORITES

Exit Priorities
---------------
Exits are given a priority according to the bit that may be on them.
Exits with no bit are considered to a have a priorty of 1. Those
lower down the hierarchy will have priorty over those that are 
higher in the hierarchy. For example,
if there is a say action on #0 with no bit attached, it has a priorty
of 1. If a player attaches a say action to themself, likewise with no
bit, it has a priorty of 1 as well, but will be used instead of the
global say action. 
However, if there is a page action on #0 that has a W2 bit, and a 
player attaches a page action to themself with no bit, then the action
on #0 will take priority and get used instead. If the player sets their
own action to W3 instead, then their personal action will take priority
over the global page command that is at W2.
Exits set = ABATE will be given a priority of lower than 0, and will
therefore always have the lowest priority among non-bitted actions.
~~~~
PARENTS|ROOM PARENTS|PARENTROOMS|PARENT ROOMS|HIERARCHY
Parent Rooms
------------
Every room on the MUCK except for #0 has a parent room. The parent room
is technically that room's location. The MUCK is built like an upside
down tree, with #0 being at the top. This is what is often reffered
to as the MUCK's hierarchy. 
It is important to realize that all of the actions available up the
hierarchy from a room will be useable by a player in that room. Since
#0 is at the top of every parent room chain, actions placed on #0 are
known as 'Globals'. Actions placed further down the hierarchy are often
referred to as 'Locals', since they can only be used by players that
are within their sub-area.
@trace is a command that helps you see how the hierarchy is set up.

See: PARENTS2
~~~~~
PARENTS2
Parent Rooms -- Continued
-------------------------
This sideways tree might help to demonstrate room hierarchy:

                  Room3    Room8
         Room2
                  Room4
Room #0   

         Room5             Room7
                  Room6    
                           Room9

Room #0 is the parent of Room2 and Room5. Room2 contains Room3 and Room4, and
Room3 contains Room8, and so on. 
A player in Room8 would be able to use an action attached to Room8, Room3, 
Room2, or Room #0, but would not have access to any actions attached to Room4, 
or any of the sub-rooms to Room5.
A player in Room9 would have access to actions in Room9, Room6, Room5, and
Room #0, but not Room7, or any of the Room2 sub-tree. 

This information is mostly for those that handle large scale building, and
isn't of great importance to those that just single room, or couple room
locations, so don't worry if it seems complicated. It is.

See: PARENTS3
~~~~
PARENTS3
Parent Rooms -- Continued - 2
-----------------------------
Just a note on how parent rooms should be used. Parent rooms should almost
NEVER be a room that players can get into. Areas should NOT be built with
the parent room being the center of town, and all other rooms in town
being built off of it, and so on. Parent rooms should only be used to
contain other rooms, and should not be part of the environment that players
can go to. If one ponders the hierarchy tree shown in PARENTS2, they will 
understand why. 

If one makes the center of town the parent room, then all of the exits in
that room will be able to all other rooms parented to it, including exits
that lead to other rooms. That's why this should be avoided. 
~~~~~
COMMAND PROPS|PROPCOMMANDS|PROP COMMANDS|COMMANDPROPS|@COMMAND
Command Props
-------------
New in Proto1.5 is the ability to create psuedo-actions by the use of 
special props called Command Props. Depending on the @tune configuration,
command props can be used by setting the following kinds of propdirs:
_command/     ~command/        @command/
_ocommand/    ~ocommand/       @ocommand/

A command prop is set by setting a prop as follows:
@set <object>=@command/<action name>:<string or dbref of a program>

For example, the following command props are all valid:
@set me=_command/mesg:A Message.   -- When that player types 'mesg', they
                                      will get notifed 'A Message.'
@set here=~command/look:$gen/look  -- When someone in that room types 'look', 
                                      they will call the $gen/look program.
@set #0=@command/say:#342          -- When someone on the muck types 'say', 
                                      then program #342 gets called.
@propset #0=dbref:@command/i:#33   -- When someone on the muck types 'i', 
                                      program #33 gets called.

See: COMMAND PROPS2, LOGINCOMMAND
~~~~~~
COMMAND PROPS2
Command Props -- Continued
--------------------------
Command props have a priorty just beneath real actions, but higher than
in-server commands.
@command props have the highest priorty while _command props have the
lowest.
When any of the valid command propdirs are set on an object, the MUCK 
sets a COMMAND flag on that object automatically. This COMMAND flag
tells the server to check that object for the presense of command props
when processing player input. By setting a NO_COMMAND flag on an object,
that object will only be checked for the @command/ propdir, but not
the other two. 
~~~~
LOGINCOMMAND|LOGINCOMMANDPROPS|LOGINCOMMANDPROP|LOGIN COMMAND|LOGIN COMMAND PROP

Login Command Props
-------------------
Similiar to the in-game @command/ props, there is also a @logincommand/ 
prop directory that can be set on #0. These allow one to add 'actions' 
to the login screen. 
The syntax is:
@logincommand/<command>:<action to perform>

The <command> will then be available from the login screen as if it 
were a normal command. Everything the user enters after the 'command'
will be the starting argument on the stack.

me @ will return #-1 in the case of login programs, but descr can
be used to notify via notify_descriptor. Players can be logged in
via @login commands by using the DESCR_SETUSER prim.

CONTAINERS|CONTAINER
Containers
----------
Any normal Thing object can be a container. As far as the in-server
get and put commands are concerned, an object becomes a container once
a @conlock is set on it. Only those that can pass the @conlock can
put things in and get things out of the container. 

However, MOST mucks have a MUF front end for get and pull that will
replace the in-server versions, so there may be different requirements
for determining what is and is not a container.

MUCK
MUCK
----
MUCK is a multi-user online server that can be used for a variety of
purposes. 

At the core, a MUCK consists of a system that allows users to connect,
communicate, create, and program. What various MUCKs do with this 
power varies, and MUCKs of all kinds can be found. MUCKs are used for
places of social gathering for those with common interests, online 
worlds in which to role play stories and events of one's own making,
a hang out for coders to sit around and program toys for their own
amusement, among other things. 

Over the years, MUCK code has become capable of some powerful things
beyond just being a text based chat server. It also includes the ability
to be a webserver, open socket connections with other servers via soft
coded programs, read and write files, and much more. The possibilities
of what any single individual will chose to do with their muck are limited
only by one's imagination...

PROTOMUCK|PROTO

ProtoMUCK
---------
ProtoMUCK picks up where NeonMUCK left off. With Neon2.17 as their starting
point, the ProtoMUCK developers made every effort to stabilize and enhance
the possibilities available to those who design and use MUCKs. 

All of the instabilities known in NeonMUCK were resolved and cleaned up,
the internal code was brought up to date with FB5.67, all of the new MUF
capabilities from the FuzzBall6 project were worked in, ideas from other
servers including MUSH, MUX, and GlowMUCK were incorporated as well. 

In addition, ProtoMUCK offers many features unique to it, such as the most
flexible ANSI support of any server, file in/out MUF prims, command props,
ways of creating actions called from the login screen, and much more. 

The ProtoMUCK Developers are listed under @credits.

PLAYER-LOCKOUTS
Player Connetion Controls
-------------------------
Note that none of these work on characters that are W1 or higher.
By setting:
@set <player>=@/lockout-msg:<mesg>
That player will be unable to connect to the MUCK. Their connection will get
dropped right after they get shown the <mesg>

Or, the alternative would be:
@set <player>=@/suspend-until:^<integer representing date in seconds>
@set <player>=@/suspend-msg:<mesg>

This would prevent the player from connecting to the MUCK until after the
date indicated by the suspend-until prop. The date is in seconds, per the
usual Unix manner of telling time. When the player gets booted from the 
login screen, they get displayed the contents of the suspend-msg prop.
~~~~
SITE-BLOCKS|
In-Server Site Banning support
------------------------------

It is possible to block specific IP addresses from establishing connections
to your MUCK by setting the proper props on #0. The sytax is:
@/sites/###.###.###.### <flag>:<reason>

For example:
@/sites/123.123.123.123 G:Problem guest connecting from this address. 

Where ###.###.###.### is the numerical IP address. The IP address can include
a little bit of pattern matching in each subset, but there must be 4 subsets
total.
'*' to represent zero or more unspecified characters, and '|', OR, for
alternate patterns. For a few valid exampls:
123.333.456.678, 1*.*.456.678, 123|321.333.456.678 
are all valid formats whereas
123*678, 123.456.789.789|123.321.123.321
are not.

The flag can be one of the following:
L = The LOCKOUT flag means characters are not able to login from that site 
    unless excused. 
G = The GUEST flag means that connections cannot be made to characters set
    GUEST from that address.
X = The BLOCKED flag prevents any connection from that address whatsoever. 
    It will be dropped immediately upon connection, without even ever seeing
    the login screen. 

Note that no matter what, localhost cannot be blocked out, so one
can always connected from it. 

Excusal from the (L) flag is done by setting the following prop on the
character to be excused:
@/sites/###.###.###.### U:<reason>
For example:
@set *Akari=@/sites/123.123.123.123 U:Excused from the siteban.

PROGRAMS|PRIMS|FUNCTIONS|MUF
MUCK PROGRAMS
-------------

Programs on a MUCK may be either MUF code or MPI code. MPI code is generally
available to all users, and can be read about by using the 'mpi' command.
MUF code usually requires a permissions bit from the staff before it can
be used, and can be read about by using the 'man' command.

Type: MAN for help about MUF code.
      MPI for help about MPI code.
~~~
THING|PROGRAM|EXIT|ROOM|PLAYER

There are 5 types of objects in the MUCK's data base. They are indicated
by the flag that is on them. 

THING (No Flag) - These are objects that can be carried around, dropped,
                  made into puppets or vehicles, and so on. These are 
                  made with @create, and removed with @recycle

PLAYER (P)      - These are the characters themselves. They are what users
                  connect to in order to get on the MUCK. They are made with
                  @pcreate and removed with @frob.

EXIT   (E)      - Exits or actions are what players use to do things while
                  on the MUCK. Exits can let players move into other rooms,
                  run a MPI or MUF program, control a puppet, among some
                  other things. They are made with either @open or @action,
                  removed with @recycle, and linked with @link.

ROOM   (R)      - Rooms are the places where everything goes. They contain
                  players, objects, and even other rooms. They are made with
                  @dig and removed with @recycle. 

MUF    (F)      - MUF code is stored in special program objects. Editing
                  these objects allows the MUF code to be altered. They are
                  made with @program, altered with @edit, and removed with
                  @recycle.
~~~~~
REGNAME|REGISTERED NAME|
RegName
-------
Putting references to data base objects as a prop on yourself or rooms
in your hierarchy makes a registered name that you can use to refer to
that object instead of its normal full name or dbref#. For example:
A prop such as _reg/rooms/home:#235
would let me refer to #235 as $rooms/home without having to remember the
number. 
@propset dbref props can work with this as well, such as:
@propset #0=dbref:_reg/lib/editor:#5543
Will make it so that program #5543 can be looked up by using:
$lib/editor instead of having to know the dbref# of lib-editor.muf every time.

Registered names are valid on yourself, or up the hierarchy. Thus registered
names on #0 are globals.
~~~~
PUPPETS
Puppets
-------
The type of puppet support available may be different from MUCK to MUCK, 
depending on how those who run it have set things up. Below are just
simple instructions that tend to be universal for making a puppet on
almost any muck that allows them:
@create <puppet>
@set <puppet>=Z
@set <puppet>=X
@flock <puppet>=me
@action <control action>=me
@link <control action>=$null
@succ <control action>={force:<puppet's dbref>,{&arg}}

Note that this may or may not work depending on settings and preferences
at various mucks, and there are better and more efficient ways to make
puppets. This is just the down and dirty way of going about it.

See: PUPPETS2
~~~~~~

Puppets - Continued
-------------------
The following commands can be used to customize your puppets even more:
@pecho - To set the prefix for notifying to you. See 'help @pecho'.

_/pcon and _/pdcon:
By setting messages in these props on the puppet object itself will
replace the default

messages for the puppets when the owner connects and disconnects.

PROPQUEUES|PROPQUEUE

Propqueues
----------
Propqueues are a way of running a series of programs when a certain action
is done. Below are the propqueues in ProtoMUCK. Type 'man propqueue' for
more details on propqueues, or 'man <propqueue name>' for more details on
a specific propqueue:
listen     - Triggered by notification to the thing or room.
alisten    - Same as listen, but keeps the ANSI codes.
connect    - When a player connects.
disconnect - When a player disconnects.
arrive     - When a player arrives.
depart     - When a player departs.
idle       - When a player idles.
unidle     - When a player unidles.
look       - When something is looked at.
login      - When a connection is made to the login screen.
disclogin  - When a connection drops from the login screen.
@dump      - On #0 only as @dump/, triggered when the MUCK saves the db.
@dumpwarn  - On #0 only as @dumpwarn/, triggered when the MUCK warns of saves.

@PORTS SUPPORT|@PORTS

@Ports Support
--------------
Finalized in Proto 1.7, @ports support allows for server admin to
start the MUCK up with using ports different from the defaults 
handled by @tune. Using this support, one can add additional ports
that duplicate the existing ones, or take advantage of a new concept
called MUF ports. There will be a MUF front end for @ports support
eventually, but for now, the manual steps to set it up are as follows:
#1
Add a list of ports in the ./proto start up script. The location to do so
is marked as:
PORTS="";
Simply insert between the "" marks a space deliminated list of additional
ports desired. This is all that is needed to open the port on start up of
the MUCK.

See @PORTS2
~~~~~
@PORTS2

@Ports - Continued
------------------
The next step is to configure how the new port is to behave, or, in other
words, what type of port it is. This is done by setting certain props on
#0. The MUCK does not have to be restarted for changes to the @ports/ 
directory to take affect.

@ports/<port#>/type:<integer prop representing the port type>
    This integer sets the type of port that the new port is to be. 
    If none is set, it defaults to behaving as a normal text port into
    the MUCK.
    0 = Text Port     (Telnet)
    1 = HTTP/WWW Port (Webserver)
    2 = Pueblo Port   (Pueblo)
    3 = MUF Port      (MUF Program)
@ports/<port#>/idle:<integer prop representing time in seconds>
    This sets how idle a connection can get to the new port before it is
    disconnected. This does not apply to MUF ports or webserver ports. It is
    optional.
@ports/<port#>/MUF:<dbref prop representing the MUF port program to call>
    If the port type is a MUF Port, then when a connection is made to the
    MUCK, this program will be run instead of the normal in-server connection
    routines.

See MUF PORTS
~~~~
MUF PORTS|MUFPORT|MUF PORT|MUFPORTS

MUF Ports
---------
A new concept introduced in ProtoMUCK is the method of creating alternate
connection routines via MUF when a connection is made to the MUCK. These 
are called when a connection is opened to a new port of type MUF. 
(See help @PORTS SUPPORT)

MUF ports behave entirely differently than normal ports. When a connection
is made to the MUF port, instead of getting the login screen and standard
connection routines, a MUF program is called. When the MUF program ceases
to run, the connection is automatically dropped from the MUCK. 

The descr_setuser prim CAN be used via a MUF port program to connect the
connection to a player, at which point, the player's connection mode changes
from MUF port to a normal text port connection.

There are some other prims that may be useful in working with MUF ports, such
as ANSI_NOTIFY_DESCRIPTOR, DESCR, DESCR_SET, and DESCR_FLAG?

@AUTOARCHIVE|AUTOARCHIVE

@autoarchive
------------
Permissions: W4 Boy

@autoarchive runs the 'archive' script stored in the same directory as the 
protomuck binary. What this script does exactly will depend on the settings
one determines in the configurable options. One should check to make sure 
that the archive script conforms to their needs before enabling this support.

@autoarchive can be run in three different ways:
On a set interval as determined by the archive_interval @tune setting.
Run in-muck by a W4 typing '@autoarchive'.
Run in the shell by typing './archive' in the directory where it is located.

To configure it so that the archives take up the least amount of space as
possible, make sure that you set the following in the 'archive' script:
ARCHIVE_LOGS = 0
REMOVE_DUMPS = 1
CLEAR_HOSTCACHE = 1
ARCHIVE_MUF = 2 
And remove the *.o files in the source directory after having compiled your MUCK.
If you chose to archive logs, make sure to clean out the oldlogs/ directory now
and then, since those can really build up over time. 

See: @AUTOARCHIVE2 for more information.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
@AUTOARCHIVE2|AUTOARCHIVE2
Note: The archive script can only be called once every 30 minutes from within the
      MUCK, though you can run it on the shell level as often as you'd like.

Disclaimer: While every measure was taken to make sure @autoarchive support is
            100% safe, it is a new concept and the chance does exist, albeit 
            unlikely, that it could damage, erase, or otherwise affect your site
            in a detrimental way. 
            It is recommended that you make an archive the old fashioned, manual
            way before switching over to this automated system. If you notice any
            unusal behavior after switching to autoarchiving, turn off the 
            auto_archive immediately and report it to the ProtoMUCK authors.
