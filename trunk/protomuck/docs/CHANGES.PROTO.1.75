Changes from 1.70 to 1.71
**Foxsteve**
- Added the RESTART, SHUTDOWN, DELTA, DUMP, and ARMAGEDDON prims to MUF. 
- Fixed various overflow crashes caused by checks not being implemented
    where they should be.
- Submitted MUF editing prims for review. Note that the MUF editng prims
    were not included in Proto1.75, but will show up in 1.80. The reason
    for this is that they will be redesigned to work with arrays instead
    of stack ranges. 
- Fixed }array, }list, and }dict to actually work. Those had gotten lost
    from compile.c at some point along the line.

* Added the define CYGWIN for defining a compile under CYGWIN.  Off by default.
  If you are compiling for Win32 under Cygwin, and define this, all will go off
  without so much as a warning.  :)  Assuming your Cygwin is configed right.

* Added the define CYGWIN_TZ and CYGWIN_TZX which defines the
   offset in hours and the label of the timezone for strftime.

* Added my comments in config.h, documenting these, and added a note to
   the USE_STRFTIME define, saying not to define it, as CYGWIN define fixes
   the protomuck strftime.

* strftime.c/format_time: For %Z: When determining the timezone, use
   whats in the define, dont try to figure it out under CYGWIN, it breaks.
   Takes the label from CYGWIN_TZX

* strftime.c/get_tz_offset: Return whats defined under CYGWIN_TZ, dont
   try to figure it out.

* interface.c/main: DETACH define fix, CYGWIN is POSIX, but doesnt
   explicitly say so.  CYGWIN define activates this fix when DETACH is defined.
   CYGWIN define tells proto to use 'setsid()' for CYGWIN.

* version.h: Update version number and specifically detect CYGWIN and display
   apporpriate version info.

* game.c: Modified @version for new version info, and to display whether it is
  compiled for Cygwin.

* Added define STAFF_POWER, by default defined, that adds a power called STAFF
   to the powers list.  It does nothing codewise, but it can be detected by
    <obj> "STAFF" power?
   This is so that you can give special priveledges in MUF to someone with that
   power set without giving them a full W.

* STAFF_POWER define activates edits in the following files to support the new
  @power: inc/db.h look.c p_db.c unparse.c wiz.c

* Fixed a crasher in fltostr() that would choke on some instances of float
  props

* Fixed a segfault crasher in CYGWIN having to do with arbitrary declarations
  of BUFFER_LEN in some buffers.

* Added two new propqueues, @dumpwarn and @dump, both called just before a dump
  warning or a dump.  They're only valid on #0, and return #-1 as the trigger,
  #1 as the player triggering, and #0 as the location, at all times.   This is
  so you can execute programs or customize messages just before a dump warning
  or a dbsave.   Considering saves are near instant due to forking, it may be
  found useful just to tune dumps up to one every 5 minutes or so, turn off
  messages, and use the dump propqueues to do any pre-dump work needed.  Both
  queues run before the message, so that you can use the queue to change the
  message.

* The new propqueues can be turned off by undefining DUMP propqueues in
  inc/config.h

* Added 'staff? ( d -- i )' primitive, inserver define for:
   dup "W" flag? "STAFF" power? or

INTERNAL:
December 10, 2001
- Fixed it so that DARK characters don't show up on the login
    WHO anymore. [Proto only bug]
- Fixed a crasher with the in-server look crashing when internal
    descs were used on things.

December 15, 2001:
- Made it so that _disconnect propqueues are called whenever a
    character is dropped, not just when it is the last connection.
    This is in line with how FB has always handled it.

Feburary 23, 2002:
- Fixed it so that failed help attempts don't show up to LOGWALL
    admin when log_failedhelp is turned off.

Feburary 24, 2002:
- Made it so that array_tree_free_node() asserts that any subnodes
    are NULL. This is to help catch any memory leaks. [FB6-change]

March 6, 2002:
- Fixed a typo in the @idesc code.

SERVER-SIDE:
December 10, 2001
- Removed the FLUSHCHANGED #ifdef from the code, since it should
    never be turned off. [FB6 change]
- Made it so that the MUCK will fork off a child process to do
    data base dumps, thus making it so that the MUCK won't have 
    to pause for dumps. [FB6 change]
- Fixed resolver to properly shutdown() indentd sockets. [FB6 fix]

December 15, 2001:
- Fixed a compiletime warning in the SMATCH prim.

Feburary 23, 2002:
- Incorporated a ton of changes made by Moose to make compiling
    WinProto a much easier process.

March 9, 2002:
- Fixed a crash related to loading floating point props.

April 18, 2002:
- Fixed it so that the webserver port will not be opened if HTTPD is
    undefined in config.h.

MPI:
December 10, 2001:
- Fixed MPI variables. Under certain condition garbage would be
    put in them because they were not initialzed properly.

MUF:
December 10, 2001:
- Fixed ARRAY_GET_PROPLIST to not get confused by null value entries
    in the list. It will create valid entries for them in the array with
    the content of '0'. [FB6 fix]
- Made it so that ARRAY_FILTER_PROP follows the same behavior as the
    SMATCH prim. [FB6 fix]

Feburary 23, 2002:
- Made it so that LOGSTATUS was understood by the interpretor.
- Made it so that flag? does not abort out on unknown flags, but
    instead returns 0.
- Fixed NEWOBJECT to allow the appropriate destinations for the new
    object to be located. 
- Fixed PNAME-OK? and NAME-OK?.

Feburary 24, 2002:
- Made array sorting use FLT_EPSILON for more accurate number 
    comparison. [FB6-change]
- Added a }join inserver define that expands to:
    } array_make \"\" array_join
- Added ARRAY_SORT_INDEXED. [FB6-addition]
- Blocked a security hole in moveto that allowed anyone to move to #0
    by trying to send something to an invalid location. [FB6-fix]
- Added ARRAY_FMTSTRING. [FB6-addition]. The code on this was formatted 
    horribly, but it's 400+ lines long, so I kinda left it as-is for 
    now. Would be nice to format it correctly sometime...

March 25, 2002:
- Fixed a crasher with NBSOCKRECV handling Invalid Host returns wrong.

March 28, 2002:
- Fixed TREAD to work correctly.
- Fixed it so that NBSOCKRECV won't infinite loop if the input has no
     end of line or character ASCII in it.
- Fixed NBSOCKRECV to ignore non-printable ASCII.
- Added NBSOCKRECV_CHAR. Only takes in 1 character at a time from the 
    input stream and pushes it onto the stack as an integer.
- Moved socket prims header stuff to p_socket.h instead of p_misc.h.

April 22, 2002:
- Fixed NBSOCKRECV to accept control characters again, and resolved
    a number of socket prim related bugs.
- Changed FINDNEXT to not abort on garbage objects. It will return 
    garbage objects if the object 
- Changed staff? to return false on players.
