==Welcome to the ProtoMUCK development wiki!==

Right now, this is mostly a reference guide for people looking to modify ProtoMUCK's source code. Eventually this will contain a few user relevant topics that aren't covered by the in-game help, such as how to compile from source.

*In-game help commands:*

_help_ - The generic help command, providing documentation of a wide range of topics relevant to users and administrators.

_man_ - The MUF manual, providing online documentation of the MUF compiler.

_mpi_ - The MPI manual, providing in-game documentation of the MPI parser.
